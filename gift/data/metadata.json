You folks are amazing and your help instrumental.\n\nOther fellows, always positive, helpful and inspiring in the best way possible even while busy with their own adventures, like @Simon Fremaux, @Carl Farterson and the best-practices gang, @Holly Grimm, and the DADA team, even if we didn't interact much directly, know you've been an inspiration for many years!\n\nAnd how can we not be grateful for the Kernel team, receiving us all with open arms and unparalleled patience and kindness, @Sachin Mittal, @Vivek Singh and others, one-of-a-kind human beings which I'm honoured to have met and spend time with. :pray:\n\nLastly, I can't write this without a special note to @cryptowanderer, embracing the project mission from the start, contributing in ways I couldn't have expected, making what the project is today a reality, you're amazing, thank you again.\n\nOne can say riding a market like we're experiencing today as a solo builder with a somewhat market-fit product can feel like choosing Jaws, Maui as a go-to surf spot while still learning to surf, sure some can pull off the once-in-a-lifetime herculean task of achieving so alone...But what enables surfers to, time and time again, execute this impressive feat, a humbling celebration of our ability to face head-first the scariest challenges posed by nature, are exactly other humans, community, supporters often not celebrated, from the tow-in jet sky riders, the lifeguards bringing you oxygen, to the chanting crowd by the coast and even the sharks keeping you alert.\n\nBack to the point, what is being done here at Kernel is unique, every step planned with a level of care hard to find elsewhere, and it is also upon us all to keep this flame awake and the kernel culture principled, I hope to in the future be able to help others the same way I was helped here, for that is what makes the world go round.\n\nFor now, thank you Kernel, for all, and happy spring! :seedling:",

From talking to Forbes and Gizmodo to being part of a huge NFT fundraiser this weekend. The last two weeks have been a wild ride and I know it started here in Kernel. I want to know that this community has my extreme gratitude and thanks.

					"message": "This is a message of gratitude to @Kris Is, who showed up at CICOLAB yesterday and gave us some great advice to check out Dandelion Mané and Source Cred. This actually was not necessarily an obvious link, because Source Cred has been coming at their solution from \"reputation,\" and we have been talking about \"matching.\" (See here for a history of this idea: <https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lYxOK30=/>). If you watch this <https://youtu.be/Ee99RK5_Jtg|condensed video (6 min)> of last night's discussion, you can see an example of what we call \"discoverability,\" which is huge problem within Kernel. This is because it is a highly innovative space, with high diversity of people from different backgrounds. That means that people might be working on different projects which might actually align in some way, but that is difficult to see on the surface (in other words, they would not be able to find each other using Google because of non-obvious search terms and lack of common language between different fields, or by simply listing what their project is about).  It takes a deeper dive into figuring out the \"why\" of what people are trying to do with their projects. So, thanks, Kris, for taking that time and making a really great connection which saved me so much work. You are a lifesaver.\n\nIn last night's session, we talked about Appreciation Bytes, our super-simple tool for noticing the often-invisible contributions of others which add to group intelligence. Our hypothesis is that we could use this to facilitate matching between a mess of groups, people, and projects, especially in a community-wide funding effort. It turns out that we have been working on the front end to what Source Cred has been developing the back end, and there is probably a high incidence of that in Kernel. Developing the machine and human technology to be able to put the memetic puzzles pieces together is a fascinating mission and one we look forward to helping to solve during our time at Kernel. @Sachin Mittal @Vivek Singh @Charles Blass",

It was sometimes tough for me to participate due to time zones but I tried to make it work the best it could. Like others, it meant that I missed some pretty interesting discussions but I was happy to listen to recordings later. It was 'tough' to work through Kernel with a hardware project, especially seeing the heavy ETH focus (in a good way)! It was fun nonetheless and got some feedback I still have to work through. As an upside, we recently applied for a grant to take the first steps into taking int into production. We aim to incorporate in Singapore due to logistic and strategic reasons, as our researched showed that Asia is the fastest growing hardware market. I talked and received feedback from many people, and for that you have my thanks! To all the others I did not get a chance to talk, perhaps we see each other in a next round. I will stick around in these Slack channels for as long as they continue to exist. I debated joining APOLLO but with some of the stuff coming up, it is too much to manage. I'd love to keep in touch or if anyone wants to reach out and join the fun. Interested in talking to people from all backgrounds. Also, we are open to investment opportunities. Cheers all!

					"message": "Here are left over thoughts &amp; some notes from our last Junto that may lend to David’s thoughts on indigenous influence in our urgent times. His great articulation of the benefits of consensus &amp; the creation of new bottom up structures-- seems to speak to where the weight of transformative power of indigenous dialogue resides. Not having to start from scratch in autonomous creation of new sustainable structures is a huge advantage we shouldn’t take for granted on any front.\n\nInsights to western misnomers of indigenous social structures through a matrilineal indigenous &amp; _Kanienke'ha'ka perspective (misnomer - Mohawk)_: \n\nFemale/Male Chief = “The Best of us”-- chosen by women title-holders with 100% consensus decision making. “(De)horned” by women when deemed ineligible for title. No campaigns or elections, to avoid any “perception of corruption.” Perceptions of possible pillow talk amongst representatives means title-holders can not be married to each other for example.\n\nHereditary - Is reference to clan —not blood, or immediate family. Used as mechanism to protect against nepotism or any “perceptions of corruption,” not to ensure nepotism as in the western context. Even if not blood &amp; across the territory for example— inter clan marriage is illegal. Representatives can not hand down title to their children-- as in the western meaning of hereditary monarchies. Clan is blood only in the case that legally clan can only be given by mother to children. If your mother is does not have a clan but your father does you are his  “__” clan “hung about the neck.” This becomes relevant in case of legal title eligibility. \n\nElected Tribal or Band councils across the hemisphere today do not abide by any of these native constitution laws —their chief title only being legal in context of municipalities of respective colonial nations — which means they have signed away their rightful nation to nation status of the Two Row Wampum Peace Treaty. We can never express our gratitude to the women of the Longhouse in Kahnawake, who have kept this Peace Treaty alive for us to leverage today. \n\nSlavery - The Longhouse is adamant about the absence of slavery in the hemisphere. The Longhouse is also always careful not to speak on the protocols of other native nations. So this strong stance on slavery is likely a reference to the continuity that also exist amongst those distinctions—from a common history &amp; cosmology “the journey of the corn.”\n\nThis is consistent with the Longhouse’s oral documentation of “the bringing into the heart fire” concept of indigenous ”justice systems.” Hereditary in the indigenous context becomes important in Wengrow’s mention of “hereditary slavery”--because it likely points to an adoption into clan mechanism, merely getting lost in an ethnographic translation. To jail or imprison a human being in Longhouse oral documentation has always been illegal. So it follows that anything even closely resembling the chattel style slavery we attach to the word would inherently be deemed illegal as well. The worst of crimes meant being marked on the face as the worst of offenders, to be easily identified by surrounding nations -- then let free in to the wilderness. Or killed immediately for the heinous offense. \n\nHinting at possible matrilineal continuity across oceans — this is also consistent with other matrilineal justice mechanisms of Africa. Mentioned by polymath, physicist, anthropologist, archaeologist, linguist, historian —Cheikh Anta Diop. Diop describes precolonial west African nations having intricate protocols for bringing local/regional rule benders into the family for a determined period of time —after which it was then illegal to ever disparage the person by even mentioning the crime or this time of the person’s life. \n\nThis last nuance actually points to elaborate cultural protections against free labor —as does clan adoption via “bringing into the heart fire” in the native context. \n\nChattel slavery is largely dependent on quite the contrary elaborate cultural mechanisms of dehumanization — rhetoric of infidels was just as pop culture as minstrel shows, toys, cartoons food labels &amp; children restaurants called “Little Black Sambo” as recent as the 80s here in the states for example. These indigenous systems seem to be humanizing as much as possible with protections against dehumanization.\n\nThis makes lot more sense than this “heart fire” phrasing being a sick euphemism for what is the Islamic origin of chattel slavery ,in which we are the most familiar in the west. As Graeber mentions the folks in the 1500s having a hard time believing natives had even heard of Jesus let alone (or practice human sacrifice to demons) denounce him. This may be a continuation of this same phenomenon via the slavery misnomer that is rooted in old world religious, political &amp; economic systems. Far removed from a precolonial native world. \n\n“The forgotten slave trade” of east Africa &amp; what was then — extensions of these east African nations into the Middle East. Resulted in an ethnic cleansing not unlike what has happened in modern Palestine in our lifetime. It also lasted long enough to overlap with the west African slave trade. \nNot unlike our real time awareness of geopolitics today, important history of both eras of African slavery are largely lost to highly politicized &amp; or religious narratives, somehow skipping over indigenous spiritual/cultural influence in the regions for millenia. Diop mentions interesting west African context often left out — the “bringing into the heart fire” style justice systems were still intact in these still precolonial black African nations — this was exploited by slave traders before raids became necessary because these nations rose to the defense of their people after discovering the crime. \n\nNone of this takes away from Graeber’s overall point of empirical political data over millenia giving robust design to political systems of the hemisphere. The details here merely add to the importance of Graeber’s work &amp; due diligence in this area of study — work virtually unprecedented in his peers past or present. These details are also likely derivatives of the formulaic aspect of indigenous modes of social organization — explaining the cultural continuity in respective hemispheres. All distinct cultures of course but also self similar like the coast lines themselves, through common cosmological significations expressing beautiful social resilience in diversity. \n\nGraeber is also spot on in another remarkable and extremely relevant way for those of us here in this cohort together. Wage slavery is another kind of slavery we are familiar with — and this is where there is some actual real independent cultural overlap! The pre-colonial Five Nations Longhouse Confederacy was on the brink of falling into perpetual cycles of wage based slavery similar but likely also distinct from modern industrialized systems. \n\nThis is oral documentation of nations coming out of war and into peace 2.5k yrs ago. Wampum shells for the beads on strings of sinew that was used for trade; were becoming commodified. Not from old world systems of settler colonial extraction &amp; military market creation of course; the shells were becoming commodified by default of nations at war. War meant it simply wasn’t safe to collect these shells from the lakes. War eventually created a corrupted mind that was content to have others work for them via control of these shells. This mind was successfully transformed with matrilineal council that protected long term, against male dominant commodification of all strains of life — this lasted up until colonization. \n\nThe League of Peace formed 2.5k yrs ago out of this empirical data matched with even older formulaic design that goes back to Sky Woman herself. This is a beautiful precedent that is desperately needed in these times. And Graeber’s words truly become prophetic in this context. @cryptowanderer @Vivek Singh @Magenta Ceiba @Sparrow Read",

This actually was not necessarily an obvious link, because Source Cred has been coming at their solution from \"reputation,\" and we have been talking about \"matching.\" (See here for a history of this idea: <https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lYxOK30=/>). If you watch this <https://youtu.be/Ee99RK5_Jtg|condensed video (6 min)> of last night's discussion, you can see an example of what we call \"discoverability,\" which is huge problem within Kernel. This is because it is a highly innovative space, with high diversity of people from different backgrounds. That means that people might be working on different projects which might actually align in some way, but that is difficult to see on the surface (in other words, they would not be able to find each other using Google because of non-obvious search terms and lack of common language between different fields, or by simply listing what their project is about).  It takes a deeper dive into figuring out the \"why\" of what people are trying to do with their projects. So, thanks, Kris, for taking that time and making a really great connection which saved me so much work. You are a lifesaver.\n\nIn last night's session, we talked about Appreciation Bytes, our super-simple tool for noticing the often-invisible contributions of others which add to group intelligence. Our hypothesis is that we could use this to facilitate matching between a mess of groups, people, and projects, especially in a community-wide funding effort. It turns out that we have been working on the front end to what Source Cred has been developing the back end, and there is probably a high incidence of that in Kernel. Developing the machine and human technology to be able to put the memetic puzzles pieces together is a fascinating mission and one we look forward to helping to solve during our time at Kernel. @Sachin Mittal @Vivek Singh @Charles Blass",

It was sometimes tough for me to participate due to time zones but I tried to make it work the best it could. Like others, it meant that I missed some pretty interesting discussions but I was happy to listen to recordings later. It was 'tough' to work through Kernel with a hardware project, especially seeing the heavy ETH focus (in a good way)! It was fun nonetheless and got some feedback I still have to work through. As an upside, we recently applied for a grant to take the first steps into taking int into production. We aim to incorporate in Singapore due to logistic and strategic reasons, as our researched showed that Asia is the fastest growing hardware market. I talked and received feedback from many people, and for that you have my thanks! To all the others I did not get a chance to talk, perhaps we see each other in a next round. I will stick around in these Slack channels for as long as they continue to exist. I debated joining APOLLO but with some of the stuff coming up, it is too much to manage. I'd love to keep in touch or if anyone wants to reach out and join the fun. Interested in talking to people from all backgrounds. Also, we are open to investment opportunities. Cheers all!

You folks are amazing and your help instrumental.\n\nOther fellows, always positive, helpful and inspiring in the best way possible even while busy with their own adventures, like @Simon Fremaux, @Carl Farterson and the best-practices gang, @Holly Grimm, and the DADA team, even if we didn't interact much directly, know you've been an inspiration for many years!\n\nAnd how can we not be grateful for the Kernel team, receiving us all with open arms and unparalleled patience and kindness, @Sachin Mittal, @Vivek Singh and others, one-of-a-kind human beings which I'm honoured to have met and spend time with. :pray:\n\nLastly, I can't write this without a special note to @cryptowanderer, embracing the project mission from the start, contributing in ways I couldn't have expected, making what the project is today a reality, you're amazing, thank you again.\n\nOne can say riding a market like we're experiencing today as a solo builder with a somewhat market-fit product can feel like choosing Jaws, Maui as a go-to surf spot while still learning to surf, sure some can pull off the once-in-a-lifetime herculean task of achieving so alone...But what enables surfers to, time and time again, execute this impressive feat, a humbling celebration of our ability to face head-first the scariest challenges posed by nature, are exactly other humans, community, supporters often not celebrated, from the tow-in jet sky riders, the lifeguards bringing you oxygen, to the chanting crowd by the coast and even the sharks keeping you alert.\n\nBack to the point, what is being done here at Kernel is unique, every step planned with a level of care hard to find elsewhere, and it is also upon us all to keep this flame awake and the kernel culture principled, I hope to in the future be able to help others the same way I was helped here, for that is what makes the world go round.\n\nFor now, thank you Kernel, for all, and happy spring! :seedling:",

					"message": "Here are left over thoughts &amp; some notes from our last Junto that may lend to David’s thoughts on indigenous influence in our urgent times. His great articulation of the benefits of consensus &amp; the creation of new bottom up structures-- seems to speak to where the weight of transformative power of indigenous dialogue resides. Not having to start from scratch in autonomous creation of new sustainable structures is a huge advantage we shouldn’t take for granted on any front.\n\nInsights to western misnomers of indigenous social structures through a matrilineal indigenous &amp; _Kanienke'ha'ka perspective (misnomer - Mohawk)_: \n\nFemale/Male Chief = “The Best of us”-- chosen by women title-holders with 100% consensus decision making. “(De)horned” by women when deemed ineligible for title. No campaigns or elections, to avoid any “perception of corruption.” Perceptions of possible pillow talk amongst representatives means title-holders can not be married to each other for example.\n\nHereditary - Is reference to clan —not blood, or immediate family. Used as mechanism to protect against nepotism or any “perceptions of corruption,” not to ensure nepotism as in the western context. Even if not blood &amp; across the territory for example— inter clan marriage is illegal. Representatives can not hand down title to their children-- as in the western meaning of hereditary monarchies. Clan is blood only in the case that legally clan can only be given by mother to children. If your mother is does not have a clan but your father does you are his  “__” clan “hung about the neck.” This becomes relevant in case of legal title eligibility. \n\nElected Tribal or Band councils across the hemisphere today do not abide by any of these native constitution laws —their chief title only being legal in context of municipalities of respective colonial nations — which means they have signed away their rightful nation to nation status of the Two Row Wampum Peace Treaty. We can never express our gratitude to the women of the Longhouse in Kahnawake, who have kept this Peace Treaty alive for us to leverage today. \n\nSlavery - The Longhouse is adamant about the absence of slavery in the hemisphere. The Longhouse is also always careful not to speak on the protocols of other native nations. So this strong stance on slavery is likely a reference to the continuity that also exist amongst those distinctions—from a common history &amp; cosmology “the journey of the corn.”\n\nThis is consistent with the Longhouse’s oral documentation of “the bringing into the heart fire” concept of indigenous ”justice systems.” Hereditary in the indigenous context becomes important in Wengrow’s mention of “hereditary slavery”--because it likely points to an adoption into clan mechanism, merely getting lost in an ethnographic translation. To jail or imprison a human being in Longhouse oral documentation has always been illegal. So it follows that anything even closely resembling the chattel style slavery we attach to the word would inherently be deemed illegal as well. The worst of crimes meant being marked on the face as the worst of offenders, to be easily identified by surrounding nations -- then let free in to the wilderness. Or killed immediately for the heinous offense. \n\nHinting at possible matrilineal continuity across oceans — this is also consistent with other matrilineal justice mechanisms of Africa. Mentioned by polymath, physicist, anthropologist, archaeologist, linguist, historian —Cheikh Anta Diop. Diop describes precolonial west African nations having intricate protocols for bringing local/regional rule benders into the family for a determined period of time —after which it was then illegal to ever disparage the person by even mentioning the crime or this time of the person’s life. \n\nThis last nuance actually points to elaborate cultural protections against free labor —as does clan adoption via “bringing into the heart fire” in the native context. \n\nChattel slavery is largely dependent on quite the contrary elaborate cultural mechanisms of dehumanization — rhetoric of infidels was just as pop culture as minstrel shows, toys, cartoons food labels &amp; children restaurants called “Little Black Sambo” as recent as the 80s here in the states for example. These indigenous systems seem to be humanizing as much as possible with protections against dehumanization.\n\nThis makes lot more sense than this “heart fire” phrasing being a sick euphemism for what is the Islamic origin of chattel slavery ,in which we are the most familiar in the west. As Graeber mentions the folks in the 1500s having a hard time believing natives had even heard of Jesus let alone (or practice human sacrifice to demons) denounce him. This may be a continuation of this same phenomenon via the slavery misnomer that is rooted in old world religious, political &amp; economic systems. Far removed from a precolonial native world. \n\n“The forgotten slave trade” of east Africa &amp; what was then — extensions of these east African nations into the Middle East. Resulted in an ethnic cleansing not unlike what has happened in modern Palestine in our lifetime. It also lasted long enough to overlap with the west African slave trade. \nNot unlike our real time awareness of geopolitics today, important history of both eras of African slavery are largely lost to highly politicized &amp; or religious narratives, somehow skipping over indigenous spiritual/cultural influence in the regions for millenia. Diop mentions interesting west African context often left out — the “bringing into the heart fire” style justice systems were still intact in these still precolonial black African nations — this was exploited by slave traders before raids became necessary because these nations rose to the defense of their people after discovering the crime. \n\nNone of this takes away from Graeber’s overall point of empirical political data over millenia giving robust design to political systems of the hemisphere. The details here merely add to the importance of Graeber’s work &amp; due diligence in this area of study — work virtually unprecedented in his peers past or present. These details are also likely derivatives of the formulaic aspect of indigenous modes of social organization — explaining the cultural continuity in respective hemispheres. All distinct cultures of course but also self similar like the coast lines themselves, through common cosmological significations expressing beautiful social resilience in diversity. \n\nGraeber is also spot on in another remarkable and extremely relevant way for those of us here in this cohort together. Wage slavery is another kind of slavery we are familiar with — and this is where there is some actual real independent cultural overlap! The pre-colonial Five Nations Longhouse Confederacy was on the brink of falling into perpetual cycles of wage based slavery similar but likely also distinct from modern industrialized systems. \n\nThis is oral documentation of nations coming out of war and into peace 2.5k yrs ago. Wampum shells for the beads on strings of sinew that was used for trade; were becoming commodified. Not from old world systems of settler colonial extraction &amp; military market creation of course; the shells were becoming commodified by default of nations at war. War meant it simply wasn’t safe to collect these shells from the lakes. War eventually created a corrupted mind that was content to have others work for them via control of these shells. This mind was successfully transformed with matrilineal council that protected long term, against male dominant commodification of all strains of life — this lasted up until colonization. \n\nThe League of Peace formed 2.5k yrs ago out of this empirical data matched with even older formulaic design that goes back to Sky Woman herself. This is a beautiful precedent that is desperately needed in these times. And Graeber’s words truly become prophetic in this context. @cryptowanderer @Vivek Singh @Magenta Ceiba @Sparrow Read",

How do we ground ourselves in a truth which can only ever be pointed at metaphorically, without falling into dogma?\nThe recital only started recording after first couple days had already past-- everyday being important. Here I will link the very important pieces to the cosmology --When hearing the four sacred ceremonies-- it reveals the indigenous modes that go beyond metaphor and into matrilineal law or constants. Cosmological significations protect against dogmatic tendencies--even if born into dogmatic surroundings &amp; predominant system--by the time one has a lifetime of the numerous matrilineal ceremonies of each 13 moon cycle --the truth reveals herself in the protocols left behind via oral documentation, symbolism &amp; cultural nuances.\nThe 100% consensus being included in the recitation &amp; processes becomes all the more important in this sense as it seems to ensure this truth does not morph into self interested opinion.\nThe capacity for the formation of the League of Peace points to this matrilineal cosmological resilience --the matrilineal decision making process &amp; Onakora creation being fundamental design for the Great Law of Peace &amp; the Two Row Wampum protocols, which grew out of the matrilineal cosmology already in place.\n\nLuckily we saved <https://www.facebook.com/530273387/videos/10156809118613388/|this recording> of Longhouse describing The Four Sacred Ceremonies in a recent council during beginning of new cycle - _not connected to the cycle of the recital linked._ \n\n_Even Stuart's own personal journey points to this--here is recording of Stuart in the <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJ7cuJ8-7fY&amp;list=PLrb8L8Q1cSngGgdI1RBjztMdOGIkstu2E&amp;ab_channel=RaymondStone|90s>. His tone overall is a lot different, Less critical of organized religion too. He is careful not to offend what are likely a lot of his own people watching, who he knows are religious. The Great Law of Peace was even mixed with religious scriptures in the region for example. We also saw the Longhouse rewrite the only written version of the Great Law too, written by quakers. This where we learned a lot of the built in male, western perspective of native culture._\n_Stuart even appeals to religious folk by making analogy of native spirituality prejudice struggles to religious prejudice struggles at one point in the video linked. Something I doubt he'd do today without critical analysis of male dominant, top down dogma.  His personal life choices &amp; transitions from traveling iron worker -- to a dedicated father &amp; devoted voice for his mothers song, when he refused to work on nuclear plant. The life threatening circumstances of retaining nationhood --but above all, his mother's clan mother teachings of not just matrilineal cosmology(dig the moon teachings on same channel too!) but also its protection mechanisms --The Great Law of Peace &amp; Two Row Wampum_ \n\nSo happy to share this all, thanks so much @cryptowanderer for continuing this thread in this unique dialogue!",

Recursion refers to a system in which  outputs  at one iteration become inputs to the   next. Feedback loops, such as a thermostat regulating temperature in an hour, would be one example. Recursion can also be visualized: self-similar repeating elements  that can be seen when holding a mirror up to another mirror, Russian nesting dolls, the chambers of a nautilus’ shell, and fractal designs like the Sierpinski triangle are all examples of recursion. Recursion is used in a more specific way in computer science, as when a function calls upon itself in order to solve a larger, more complex problem (Hofstadter 1999). \n&gt; Recursion is a powerful concept that has a very specific definition in mathematics and computer science. I have chosen to coin the neologism “recursivity” for two reasons. First, I do not want to instigate debates about whether or not something is “truly” recursive in the mathematical   sense. \n&gt; Recursion is a  conceptual  basis for recursivity in the same way that “equality” is a conceptual basis for democracy; one need not ask how mathematicians define equality to use it. I want to make a clear distinction between the mathematical source material I am drawing from, and the kind of social relations that recursivity promotes. Recursivity is a social condition, not the dutiful execution of a mathematical property. In the same way, a worker that has been scientifically and minutely exploited through computer-aided Taylorism embodies an idea of efficiency, but this is still a far cry from the abstraction of efficiency in physics which might require a frictionless environment, bodies with infinite hardness or other precise idealizations.",

I can now see why our Invisible Economy meetings felt so natural to you - the kind of discussion and synthesising of all that is said is very similar!  Amazing to me now that we developed this kind of process without knowing about the tradition that is behind it.  I did begin to write a bit about this process on our own <https://invisibleeconomy.github.io/StartHere/|github pages here> in the section under Working Groups.  I'd be happy to take that from there and simply include a link to that info if you think it would make a good addition to the Kernel pages @cryptowanderer?\n\nThe personal story that was shared was really very powerful, and I love the fact that she wants it to be only an audio book, in line with an oral tradition.  I also had a thought, Harold: Have you mentioned the meeting next Saturday to @Holly Grimm?  I know she is super busy with her research, but she may have a piece of the puzzle when it comes to water...",

					"message": "@cryptowanderer Wow mane ty kindly for this, powerful on many levels. You seem to hold a whole lot of transformative power mane. Please treat the council as we plan to treat KERNEL --and never leave haha :pray::skin-tone-5: The capacity for open ears to matrilineal indigenous words is historically easier said than done in every instance of acculturation, across geographies. Your words &amp; temperament expressed here seem to point to more than a shift in dissonance on the individual scale, but on the collective. As we all try to work our way out of this top down fragmentation of our humanity. To embrace our respective matrilineal heritage is a great filter for recognizing what has always been, and what was most recently added or removed. This is ultimately a means for rediscovering our true place in time &amp; space.\n\nHere we are, gifted with pieces of know how of the stars, passed down by our mothers. The knowledge of where we are in the cycles of the stars enables us move accordingly without fear but with thankfulness, respect &amp; ceremony for the impact of the design around us. It's this thankfulness built into cosmologies that allowed our mothers to co evolve with not just corn but with landscape scale ecosystem modification that gives us most of our food. Managed buffalo migrations even causing rising dirt to fall and fertilize soils in Europe. It's this thankfulness that allows indigenous modes of sciences to lead us to flourishing co evolution.\n\nWhen hearing the gratitude you gave to the women in your life, it gives the overwhelming feeling that it's this honoring of our life givers that can get us back to designing &amp; engineering this fecundity of co evolution :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nHappy to expand on this bridge &amp; home idea in Kanienkeha linguistics! Just learned of this myself so very excited to explore.\n\n&gt; _come home_, dear one. Come back to the heart’s fire. It is time to begin again",

I mean, everything did in one way or another, but this one particularly felt like there was so much more to unlock to really understand the lessons to be learned here.\n\n`Minding the peace - The League of Peace formed 2,500 years ago as a response to the social climate in North America. The commodification of wampum shells at the time led to the outbreak of war. War meant it simply wasn't safe to collect these shells from the lakes. In the tradition, war is the result of - and perpetuates - a corrupted mind which is content to have others work for it via control and commodification. This mind was successfully transformed by the matrilineal council that protected long term peace, right up until total colonization.`\n\nWhen we commodify things, could it be that this is always the inevitable result? The act of commodification attempts to assign a 'value' to something.  Which works for goods, so they can be exchanged.  But we don't stop there.  When we turn living things, and people, into commodities that can be exchanged (human 'resources' our companies call them) this seems to only ever result in the killing of the thing we have tried to put a 'value' on.\n\nThere are many thing in just this one story that feels to me like important wisdom lost or ignored in much of what we see happening now.",

					"message": "Hey all, time flew, and now with things calming down a bit, I want to express my gratitude towards those that made the past few months so special, It was a big wave for me and ethblockart, and without the help of mentors, fellows, and the kernel team, I wouldn't have been able to stay atop the surfboard!\n\nFor starters, I wanna express my gratitude towards many of the mentors, present and supportive in genuinely important ways throughout this adventure: Defi_Dad, @Thomas Klocanas, @Linda Xie, @Shawn Cheng @Ben Lakoff, @Dave Rodman, @Harsh Rajat and @Scott Moore. You folks are amazing and your help instrumental.\n\nOther fellows, always positive, helpful and inspiring in the best way possible even while busy with their own adventures, like @Simon Fremaux, @Carl Farterson and the best-practices gang, @Holly Grimm, and the DADA team, even if we didn't interact much directly, know you've been an inspiration for many years!\n\nAnd how can we not be grateful for the Kernel team, receiving us all with open arms and unparalleled patience and kindness, @Sachin Mittal, @Vivek Singh and others, one-of-a-kind human beings which I'm honoured to have met and spend time with. :pray:\n\nLastly, I can't write this without a special note to @cryptowanderer, embracing the project mission from the start, contributing in ways I couldn't have expected, making what the project is today a reality, you're amazing, thank you again.\n\nOne can say riding a market like we're experiencing today as a solo builder with a somewhat market-fit product can feel like choosing Jaws, Maui as a go-to surf spot while still learning to surf, sure some can pull off the once-in-a-lifetime herculean task of achieving so alone...But what enables surfers to, time and time again, execute this impressive feat, a humbling celebration of our ability to face head-first the scariest challenges posed by nature, are exactly other humans, community, supporters often not celebrated, from the tow-in jet sky riders, the lifeguards bringing you oxygen, to the chanting crowd by the coast and even the sharks keeping you alert.\n\nBack to the point, what is being done here at Kernel is unique, every step planned with a level of care hard to find elsewhere, and it is also upon us all to keep this flame awake and the kernel culture principled, I hope to in the future be able to help others the same way I was helped here, for that is what makes the world go round.\n\nFor now, thank you Kernel, for all, and happy spring! :seedling:",

The range of concepts, fierce intellect and enormous compassion that I've been exposed to will be unforgettable.\n\nWhen I started, I was deeply apathetic about the future of the human experience. But I leave KERNEL with a deep sense of optimism, tremendous excitement, and hope for humanity. You are all inspiring people, and I'm indebted to everyone who held my hand into the Web3 rabbit hole.\n\nThe world now appears as beautiful to me as it once had when I was a little kid. And I really mean that. Maybe that's Beginner's Mind.\n\n@Vivek Singh @Sachin Mittal @cryptowanderer @arya @Amy of BFLO @Ricsson Ngo THANK YOU!!!\n\nTo everyone I never got to meet... I just know in my heart that you're awesome people too. Thank you so much for being the ornate, intricate cogs of decentralization that you are.",

The intention was just get together, geek out on all things decarbonising web 3 &amp; leveraging things like DeFi to accelerate the vision of a planet positive, carbon negative future for all including jamming on things like the devastation faced by our oceans in example.\n\nIf you missed it, don't worry, you can find the recording in <#C01UUEDM934|feed-session-recordings> but essentially we spent a lot of time on intros &amp; getting to know each other better which was lovely, had some climate convo led by @Raphael Haupt &amp; some others, deciding that essentially we would co-ord in <#C01KHR1M0LA|jam-climate> &amp; find a time that suited all of us as best as possible to make the event a reoccurring thing.\n\nThanks to all the fantastic people &amp; minds that attended @Abe Uccello @Ben Lakoff @Holly Grimm @Raphael Haupt @Kevin Davis @Laurens De Poorter @Robin Roy Thomas.  Sorry to the people I've missed, had some difficulty finding your Slack @. Please DM me so can add you to the thread if you see this! :slightly_smiling_face:\n\n#CLIMATEGANG",

You folks are amazing and your help instrumental.\n\nOther fellows, always positive, helpful and inspiring in the best way possible even while busy with their own adventures, like @Simon Fremaux, @Carl Farterson and the best-practices gang, @Holly Grimm, and the DADA team, even if we didn't interact much directly, know you've been an inspiration for many years!\n\nAnd how can we not be grateful for the Kernel team, receiving us all with open arms and unparalleled patience and kindness, @Sachin Mittal, @Vivek Singh and others, one-of-a-kind human beings which I'm honoured to have met and spend time with. :pray:\n\nLastly, I can't write this without a special note to @cryptowanderer, embracing the project mission from the start, contributing in ways I couldn't have expected, making what the project is today a reality, you're amazing, thank you again.\n\nOne can say riding a market like we're experiencing today as a solo builder with a somewhat market-fit product can feel like choosing Jaws, Maui as a go-to surf spot while still learning to surf, sure some can pull off the once-in-a-lifetime herculean task of achieving so alone...But what enables surfers to, time and time again, execute this impressive feat, a humbling celebration of our ability to face head-first the scariest challenges posed by nature, are exactly other humans, community, supporters often not celebrated, from the tow-in jet sky riders, the lifeguards bringing you oxygen, to the chanting crowd by the coast and even the sharks keeping you alert.\n\nBack to the point, what is being done here at Kernel is unique, every step planned with a level of care hard to find elsewhere, and it is also upon us all to keep this flame awake and the kernel culture principled, I hope to in the future be able to help others the same way I was helped here, for that is what makes the world go round.\n\nFor now, thank you Kernel, for all, and happy spring! :seedling:",

Would you like me to put this into a piece, or are you happy to keep honing it until you feel it's right and are ready to submit a PR/doc for me? My one thought is about the danger of exclusive focus. That is, while I agree that the ground itself is always experiential, I do think that it must be balanced by some kind of rigor. How to come to this without falling into the trap of a will to power or attempt to control/make legible is my question. If we say it's _only_ about experience, then there are no reasonable grounds on which to engage meaningfully and we end up in the so-called New Age.\n\n@Sebnem wonderful to have you back :pray: thank you for this insightful pattern re-cognition: it is deeply helpful for me.\n\n&gt; I'm still unable to formulate what this is about, what is it that \"practically\" we're talking about.\nYour scare quotes indicate the understanding that what we're talking about is not practical in the general meaning of that word (for this reason, by the rule of complementary opposites, it is the only truly practical knowledge we can cultivate). What we're talking about is, in a profound way, far less important than the fact we are talking. That's meta Level 1. First, we develop awareness of awareness. Then, we recognise that the fact we're talking is most critical, but what we are saying is also genuinely important - not in terms of our own opinion, but in terms of seeing ourselves more clearly (i.e. my realisation about synthesis and power was a major moment for me - meta Level 2). Awareness of awareness of awareness. It is this doubly-aware mind which sees that the drive to connect with the other is a part of seeing our own self more clearly: for the more intimate and immediate the connection, the clearer the mirror.\n\nSelf-recursively honing awareness through dialogue, through lived contemplation in honest reflection with others, is a large part of how I experience interactions like this. Awareness bent back on itself with skill eventually \"disappears\". There is the open field beyond right or wrong. There is 'satori': a sudden and ecstatic insight into the ground of your own being. There is the silence which comes home to stay in a heart that has been emptied of all its images, leaving only the unconditional love which is its nature; its origin and destiny. There there are no more formulas, no more words...",

The Longhouse interaction in the this context was fascinating to witness and study general feel of what is an extension of Two Row Wampum protocols for peace. \"Expanding the dream\" was a simple motif that emerged when discussing interdisciplinary prototyping for systems design. Despite largely disparate backgrounds &amp; geographies, there was a common understanding of *where we are*, juxtaposed with where we are coming from &amp; where we are planning to go. The Longhouse often saying \"there's no leaf suspended in air attached to nothing.\" This seems to beg your question on the power of questions to induce peace. This seems to be the case, especially in spaces of consensus. This is why the Longhouse protocols for peaceful dialogue layered atop of consensus is a remarkable _*tool*_ to have access to in our times. \"The enzyme that manages the connections of thee double helix.\" Indeed @Sebnem ---- _\"This seems a natural evolution, a pull, an \"ontological buoyancy\" towards unity\"_",

Upvest moved away from doing that due to investor pressure and market cap constraints on security tokenization plus the regulatory landscape in Germany.. and went full steam ahead in fintech with building a securities API as a neo-broker and basically getting BaFin licensed as a custodian (so like a bank - competing with the likes of solarisbank but slowly becoming like the “robinhood” for securities APIs in Germany).. [they were non-custodial before] They then hired a new CTO from transferwise, CPO from Raisin and old timer banking professionals.  Along with a (3rd) complete overhaul of the backend tech stack (always being an API company though)... Python to TS/JS to Golang.

The following two case studies / pre-reads were recommended and helped aid the lively discussion.\n1. <https://blog.blocknative.com/blog/mempool-forensics|Mempool forensics> :bowl_with_spoon: \n2. <https://www.covalenthq.com/blog/covalent-defi-sdk/|Covalent SDK> :alembic: \nWhile Chris explored the ideas of _value in motion_  :star2:  covering mempool traffic :vertical_traffic_light: analytics and notifications :1234: with us. Ganesh balanced the remaining from where Chris left off by exploring _value at rest_ :cake: with smart-contracts &amp; transactions analytics.\n\nWe also gained valuable insights on historically underlooked mempool data while taking into consideration the performance of the different kinds of nodes in the Ethereum :city_sunset: network including but not limited to how they skew any assumptions on transaction (type) distribution that we might make. Active nonce :1234: and gas price :fuelpump: management for stuck, pending and dropped, mempool transaction :swimmer: and block explorers :building_construction: data stores. We further explored on-chain data usage for delivering insights by restructuring it into a consumable formats while covering topics like EVM  :nerd_face: optimisations, performance considerations in DB latency vs verifiability :checkered_flag: rollups :space_invader: vs single row :table_tennis_paddle_and_ball: lookups, OLTP and OLAP databases, and DB primitives :construction_worker:. The overarching theme was on how we could bridge the legacy DB :steam_locomotive: world onto blockchain :bullettrain_front: and how the technologies we’re building could aid that vision.\n\nEffectively this junto covered the entire spectrum of the happenings in the life of an Ethereum transaction :money_with_wings: and the value that it carries every step of the way. :roller_coaster: I  would highly recommend reaching out to the mentors for anything (even remotely) related to data on blockchain and look forward to our next Junto on one or more of the discussed specifics. @Sachin Mittal thanks a ton for organising this and to all the participants for engaging! One of the best Junto’s for me personally... :fire: :fireworks: :seedling:",

The following two case studies / pre-reads were recommended and helped aid the lively discussion.\n1. <https://blog.blocknative.com/blog/mempool-forensics|Mempool forensics> :bowl_with_spoon: \n2. <https://www.covalenthq.com/blog/covalent-defi-sdk/|Covalent SDK> :alembic: \nWhile Chris explored the ideas of _value in motion_  :star2:  covering mempool traffic :vertical_traffic_light: analytics and notifications :1234: with us. Ganesh balanced the remaining from where Chris left off by exploring _value at rest_ :cake: with smart-contracts &amp; transactions analytics.\n\nWe also gained valuable insights on historically underlooked mempool data while taking into consideration the performance of the different kinds of nodes in the Ethereum :city_sunset: network including but not limited to how they skew any assumptions on transaction (type) distribution that we might make. Active nonce :1234: and gas price :fuelpump: management for stuck, pending and dropped, mempool transaction :swimmer: and block explorers :building_construction: data stores. We further explored on-chain data usage for delivering insights by restructuring it into a consumable formats while covering topics like EVM  :nerd_face: optimisations, performance considerations in DB latency vs verifiability :checkered_flag: rollups :space_invader: vs single row :table_tennis_paddle_and_ball: lookups, OLTP and OLAP databases, and DB primitives :construction_worker:. The overarching theme was on how we could bridge the legacy DB :steam_locomotive: world onto blockchain :bullettrain_front: and how the technologies we’re building could aid that vision.\n\nEffectively this junto covered the entire spectrum of the happenings in the life of an Ethereum transaction :money_with_wings: and the value that it carries every step of the way. :roller_coaster: I  would highly recommend reaching out to the mentors for anything (even remotely) related to data on blockchain and look forward to our next Junto on one or more of the discussed specifics. @Sachin Mittal thanks a ton for organising this and to all the participants for engaging! One of the best Junto’s for me personally... :fire: :fireworks: :seedling:",

					"message": "This is a message of gratitude to @Kris Is, who showed up at CICOLAB yesterday and gave us some great advice to check out Dandelion Mané and Source Cred. This actually was not necessarily an obvious link, because Source Cred has been coming at their solution from \"reputation,\" and we have been talking about \"matching.\" (See here for a history of this idea: <https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lYxOK30=/>). If you watch this <https://youtu.be/Ee99RK5_Jtg|condensed video (6 min)> of last night's discussion, you can see an example of what we call \"discoverability,\" which is huge problem within Kernel. This is because it is a highly innovative space, with high diversity of people from different backgrounds. That means that people might be working on different projects which might actually align in some way, but that is difficult to see on the surface (in other words, they would not be able to find each other using Google because of non-obvious search terms and lack of common language between different fields, or by simply listing what their project is about).  It takes a deeper dive into figuring out the \"why\" of what people are trying to do with their projects. So, thanks, Kris, for taking that time and making a really great connection which saved me so much work. You are a lifesaver.\n\nIn last night's session, we talked about Appreciation Bytes, our super-simple tool for noticing the often-invisible contributions of others which add to group intelligence. Our hypothesis is that we could use this to facilitate matching between a mess of groups, people, and projects, especially in a community-wide funding effort. It turns out that we have been working on the front end to what Source Cred has been developing the back end, and there is probably a high incidence of that in Kernel. Developing the machine and human technology to be able to put the memetic puzzles pieces together is a fascinating mission and one we look forward to helping to solve during our time at Kernel. @Sachin Mittal @Vivek Singh @Charles Blass",

You helped me form a “we” instead of a “me, the lone nut”, and that has made all the difference.\n@Lauren Nignon*,* you had the empathy to recognise something in me, encouraged my craziness and made me feel welcomed. \n@Petr Porobov, you are so crazy and passionate about Upala, that you made me feel like I’m home in this setting.\n@Samuel Tang, your interest in the idea and the offer to contribute to Agadom assured us that we are on the right track.\n\n@cryptowanderer Thank you for the flashlight.",

This actually was not necessarily an obvious link, because Source Cred has been coming at their solution from \"reputation,\" and we have been talking about \"matching.\" (See here for a history of this idea: <https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lYxOK30=/>). If you watch this <https://youtu.be/Ee99RK5_Jtg|condensed video (6 min)> of last night's discussion, you can see an example of what we call \"discoverability,\" which is huge problem within Kernel. This is because it is a highly innovative space, with high diversity of people from different backgrounds. That means that people might be working on different projects which might actually align in some way, but that is difficult to see on the surface (in other words, they would not be able to find each other using Google because of non-obvious search terms and lack of common language between different fields, or by simply listing what their project is about).  It takes a deeper dive into figuring out the \"why\" of what people are trying to do with their projects. So, thanks, Kris, for taking that time and making a really great connection which saved me so much work. You are a lifesaver.\n\nIn last night's session, we talked about Appreciation Bytes, our super-simple tool for noticing the often-invisible contributions of others which add to group intelligence. Our hypothesis is that we could use this to facilitate matching between a mess of groups, people, and projects, especially in a community-wide funding effort. It turns out that we have been working on the front end to what Source Cred has been developing the back end, and there is probably a high incidence of that in Kernel. Developing the machine and human technology to be able to put the memetic puzzles pieces together is a fascinating mission and one we look forward to helping to solve during our time at Kernel. @Sachin Mittal @Vivek Singh @Charles Blass",

You folks are amazing and your help instrumental.\n\nOther fellows, always positive, helpful and inspiring in the best way possible even while busy with their own adventures, like @Simon Fremaux, @Carl Farterson and the best-practices gang, @Holly Grimm, and the DADA team, even if we didn't interact much directly, know you've been an inspiration for many years!\n\nAnd how can we not be grateful for the Kernel team, receiving us all with open arms and unparalleled patience and kindness, @Sachin Mittal, @Vivek Singh and others, one-of-a-kind human beings which I'm honoured to have met and spend time with. :pray:\n\nLastly, I can't write this without a special note to @cryptowanderer, embracing the project mission from the start, contributing in ways I couldn't have expected, making what the project is today a reality, you're amazing, thank you again.\n\nOne can say riding a market like we're experiencing today as a solo builder with a somewhat market-fit product can feel like choosing Jaws, Maui as a go-to surf spot while still learning to surf, sure some can pull off the once-in-a-lifetime herculean task of achieving so alone...But what enables surfers to, time and time again, execute this impressive feat, a humbling celebration of our ability to face head-first the scariest challenges posed by nature, are exactly other humans, community, supporters often not celebrated, from the tow-in jet sky riders, the lifeguards bringing you oxygen, to the chanting crowd by the coast and even the sharks keeping you alert.\n\nBack to the point, what is being done here at Kernel is unique, every step planned with a level of care hard to find elsewhere, and it is also upon us all to keep this flame awake and the kernel culture principled, I hope to in the future be able to help others the same way I was helped here, for that is what makes the world go round.\n\nFor now, thank you Kernel, for all, and happy spring! :seedling:",

					"message": "Here are left over thoughts &amp; some notes from our last Junto that may lend to David’s thoughts on indigenous influence in our urgent times. His great articulation of the benefits of consensus &amp; the creation of new bottom up structures-- seems to speak to where the weight of transformative power of indigenous dialogue resides. Not having to start from scratch in autonomous creation of new sustainable structures is a huge advantage we shouldn’t take for granted on any front.\n\nInsights to western misnomers of indigenous social structures through a matrilineal indigenous &amp; _Kanienke'ha'ka perspective (misnomer - Mohawk)_: \n\nFemale/Male Chief = “The Best of us”-- chosen by women title-holders with 100% consensus decision making. “(De)horned” by women when deemed ineligible for title. No campaigns or elections, to avoid any “perception of corruption.” Perceptions of possible pillow talk amongst representatives means title-holders can not be married to each other for example.\n\nHereditary - Is reference to clan —not blood, or immediate family. Used as mechanism to protect against nepotism or any “perceptions of corruption,” not to ensure nepotism as in the western context. Even if not blood &amp; across the territory for example— inter clan marriage is illegal. Representatives can not hand down title to their children-- as in the western meaning of hereditary monarchies. Clan is blood only in the case that legally clan can only be given by mother to children. If your mother is does not have a clan but your father does you are his  “__” clan “hung about the neck.” This becomes relevant in case of legal title eligibility. \n\nElected Tribal or Band councils across the hemisphere today do not abide by any of these native constitution laws —their chief title only being legal in context of municipalities of respective colonial nations — which means they have signed away their rightful nation to nation status of the Two Row Wampum Peace Treaty. We can never express our gratitude to the women of the Longhouse in Kahnawake, who have kept this Peace Treaty alive for us to leverage today. \n\nSlavery - The Longhouse is adamant about the absence of slavery in the hemisphere. The Longhouse is also always careful not to speak on the protocols of other native nations. So this strong stance on slavery is likely a reference to the continuity that also exist amongst those distinctions—from a common history &amp; cosmology “the journey of the corn.”\n\nThis is consistent with the Longhouse’s oral documentation of “the bringing into the heart fire” concept of indigenous ”justice systems.” Hereditary in the indigenous context becomes important in Wengrow’s mention of “hereditary slavery”--because it likely points to an adoption into clan mechanism, merely getting lost in an ethnographic translation. To jail or imprison a human being in Longhouse oral documentation has always been illegal. So it follows that anything even closely resembling the chattel style slavery we attach to the word would inherently be deemed illegal as well. The worst of crimes meant being marked on the face as the worst of offenders, to be easily identified by surrounding nations -- then let free in to the wilderness. Or killed immediately for the heinous offense. \n\nHinting at possible matrilineal continuity across oceans — this is also consistent with other matrilineal justice mechanisms of Africa. Mentioned by polymath, physicist, anthropologist, archaeologist, linguist, historian —Cheikh Anta Diop. Diop describes precolonial west African nations having intricate protocols for bringing local/regional rule benders into the family for a determined period of time —after which it was then illegal to ever disparage the person by even mentioning the crime or this time of the person’s life. \n\nThis last nuance actually points to elaborate cultural protections against free labor —as does clan adoption via “bringing into the heart fire” in the native context. \n\nChattel slavery is largely dependent on quite the contrary elaborate cultural mechanisms of dehumanization — rhetoric of infidels was just as pop culture as minstrel shows, toys, cartoons food labels &amp; children restaurants called “Little Black Sambo” as recent as the 80s here in the states for example. These indigenous systems seem to be humanizing as much as possible with protections against dehumanization.\n\nThis makes lot more sense than this “heart fire” phrasing being a sick euphemism for what is the Islamic origin of chattel slavery ,in which we are the most familiar in the west. As Graeber mentions the folks in the 1500s having a hard time believing natives had even heard of Jesus let alone (or practice human sacrifice to demons) denounce him. This may be a continuation of this same phenomenon via the slavery misnomer that is rooted in old world religious, political &amp; economic systems. Far removed from a precolonial native world. \n\n“The forgotten slave trade” of east Africa &amp; what was then — extensions of these east African nations into the Middle East. Resulted in an ethnic cleansing not unlike what has happened in modern Palestine in our lifetime. It also lasted long enough to overlap with the west African slave trade. \nNot unlike our real time awareness of geopolitics today, important history of both eras of African slavery are largely lost to highly politicized &amp; or religious narratives, somehow skipping over indigenous spiritual/cultural influence in the regions for millenia. Diop mentions interesting west African context often left out — the “bringing into the heart fire” style justice systems were still intact in these still precolonial black African nations — this was exploited by slave traders before raids became necessary because these nations rose to the defense of their people after discovering the crime. \n\nNone of this takes away from Graeber’s overall point of empirical political data over millenia giving robust design to political systems of the hemisphere. The details here merely add to the importance of Graeber’s work &amp; due diligence in this area of study — work virtually unprecedented in his peers past or present. These details are also likely derivatives of the formulaic aspect of indigenous modes of social organization — explaining the cultural continuity in respective hemispheres. All distinct cultures of course but also self similar like the coast lines themselves, through common cosmological significations expressing beautiful social resilience in diversity. \n\nGraeber is also spot on in another remarkable and extremely relevant way for those of us here in this cohort together. Wage slavery is another kind of slavery we are familiar with — and this is where there is some actual real independent cultural overlap! The pre-colonial Five Nations Longhouse Confederacy was on the brink of falling into perpetual cycles of wage based slavery similar but likely also distinct from modern industrialized systems. \n\nThis is oral documentation of nations coming out of war and into peace 2.5k yrs ago. Wampum shells for the beads on strings of sinew that was used for trade; were becoming commodified. Not from old world systems of settler colonial extraction &amp; military market creation of course; the shells were becoming commodified by default of nations at war. War meant it simply wasn’t safe to collect these shells from the lakes. War eventually created a corrupted mind that was content to have others work for them via control of these shells. This mind was successfully transformed with matrilineal council that protected long term, against male dominant commodification of all strains of life — this lasted up until colonization. \n\nThe League of Peace formed 2.5k yrs ago out of this empirical data matched with even older formulaic design that goes back to Sky Woman herself. This is a beautiful precedent that is desperately needed in these times. And Graeber’s words truly become prophetic in this context. @cryptowanderer @Vivek Singh @Magenta Ceiba @Sparrow Read",

					"message": "There seems to be an intricate relationship to war &amp; commodification. In the oral documentation, war is what leads to the commodification of the wampum shells, not the other way around. This suggests that protections for matrilineal heritage in all strains of life embedded into collective decision making processes for peaceful diplomacy between nations is imperative for longterm sustainability in complex systems.\n\nWithout this protection, everything is at risk of commodification --war seems to create an artificial scarcity that bleeds into every aspect of our social &amp; eco organization. Artificial scarcity replaces the reality of regenerative abundance --hence the harm of a global male dominant system. The commodification starts with our means for tracking morphology of long term dynamics --wampum shells. Indigenous modes of tracking transactions were less about value placement than ensuring balance was being maintained in complex dynamics. \"Balance always has to come from where there is more\"-- making value placements on goods less relevant than the mechanism of keeping record.\n\nAfter our tracking mechanisms are compromised, your presumption of untamed brutal extraction/commodification to follow seems spot on. What is ultimately a tool for tracking the collective health of our mother's body (Earth) becomes a tool for her brutalization. A fundamental belief of regenerative abundance is replaced with a fundamental belief of scarcity. Our entire regenerative heritage is then made invisible &amp; then easily exploited, from smallest levels to the largest levels of Sky Woman's spiral design. This is identified in the oral documentation very clearly.\n\nThank you kindly for this keen observation @Sparrow Read :heart:",

Many of the touchiest points of dialogue have fairly clear paths for tangible \"engaged respect and a common aim of living together, instead of converting one another..\" Matrilineal heritage might cut right across the board, as means for common understanding.\nFrom regenerative concepts through to appropriation of power in communities on the fringes of any given predominant system. Our matrilineal heritage is being made explicit by the current urgency emitting from our common body of Mother Earth, that our faces yet beneath her, all grow from-- to live together, protecting, healing, and (co)evolving with her, deigning as good minded ancestors of nations that keep their respective ceremonies, forever.:fist::skin-tone-5:",

					"message": "@Sparrow Read thank you so much. I agree and appreciate what you have added. Would you like me to put this into a piece, or are you happy to keep honing it until you feel it's right and are ready to submit a PR/doc for me? My one thought is about the danger of exclusive focus. That is, while I agree that the ground itself is always experiential, I do think that it must be balanced by some kind of rigor. How to come to this without falling into the trap of a will to power or attempt to control/make legible is my question. If we say it's _only_ about experience, then there are no reasonable grounds on which to engage meaningfully and we end up in the so-called New Age.\n\n@Sebnem wonderful to have you back :pray: thank you for this insightful pattern re-cognition: it is deeply helpful for me.\n\n&gt; I'm still unable to formulate what this is about, what is it that \"practically\" we're talking about.\nYour scare quotes indicate the understanding that what we're talking about is not practical in the general meaning of that word (for this reason, by the rule of complementary opposites, it is the only truly practical knowledge we can cultivate). What we're talking about is, in a profound way, far less important than the fact we are talking. That's meta Level 1. First, we develop awareness of awareness. Then, we recognise that the fact we're talking is most critical, but what we are saying is also genuinely important - not in terms of our own opinion, but in terms of seeing ourselves more clearly (i.e. my realisation about synthesis and power was a major moment for me - meta Level 2). Awareness of awareness of awareness. It is this doubly-aware mind which sees that the drive to connect with the other is a part of seeing our own self more clearly: for the more intimate and immediate the connection, the clearer the mirror.\n\nSelf-recursively honing awareness through dialogue, through lived contemplation in honest reflection with others, is a large part of how I experience interactions like this. Awareness bent back on itself with skill eventually \"disappears\". There is the open field beyond right or wrong. There is 'satori': a sudden and ecstatic insight into the ground of your own being. There is the silence which comes home to stay in a heart that has been emptied of all its images, leaving only the unconditional love which is its nature; its origin and destiny. There there are no more formulas, no more words...",

					"message": "Here are left over thoughts &amp; some notes from our last Junto that may lend to David’s thoughts on indigenous influence in our urgent times. His great articulation of the benefits of consensus &amp; the creation of new bottom up structures-- seems to speak to where the weight of transformative power of indigenous dialogue resides. Not having to start from scratch in autonomous creation of new sustainable structures is a huge advantage we shouldn’t take for granted on any front.\n\nInsights to western misnomers of indigenous social structures through a matrilineal indigenous &amp; _Kanienke'ha'ka perspective (misnomer - Mohawk)_: \n\nFemale/Male Chief = “The Best of us”-- chosen by women title-holders with 100% consensus decision making. “(De)horned” by women when deemed ineligible for title. No campaigns or elections, to avoid any “perception of corruption.” Perceptions of possible pillow talk amongst representatives means title-holders can not be married to each other for example.\n\nHereditary - Is reference to clan —not blood, or immediate family. Used as mechanism to protect against nepotism or any “perceptions of corruption,” not to ensure nepotism as in the western context. Even if not blood &amp; across the territory for example— inter clan marriage is illegal. Representatives can not hand down title to their children-- as in the western meaning of hereditary monarchies. Clan is blood only in the case that legally clan can only be given by mother to children. If your mother is does not have a clan but your father does you are his  “__” clan “hung about the neck.” This becomes relevant in case of legal title eligibility. \n\nElected Tribal or Band councils across the hemisphere today do not abide by any of these native constitution laws —their chief title only being legal in context of municipalities of respective colonial nations — which means they have signed away their rightful nation to nation status of the Two Row Wampum Peace Treaty. We can never express our gratitude to the women of the Longhouse in Kahnawake, who have kept this Peace Treaty alive for us to leverage today. \n\nSlavery - The Longhouse is adamant about the absence of slavery in the hemisphere. The Longhouse is also always careful not to speak on the protocols of other native nations. So this strong stance on slavery is likely a reference to the continuity that also exist amongst those distinctions—from a common history &amp; cosmology “the journey of the corn.”\n\nThis is consistent with the Longhouse’s oral documentation of “the bringing into the heart fire” concept of indigenous ”justice systems.” Hereditary in the indigenous context becomes important in Wengrow’s mention of “hereditary slavery”--because it likely points to an adoption into clan mechanism, merely getting lost in an ethnographic translation. To jail or imprison a human being in Longhouse oral documentation has always been illegal. So it follows that anything even closely resembling the chattel style slavery we attach to the word would inherently be deemed illegal as well. The worst of crimes meant being marked on the face as the worst of offenders, to be easily identified by surrounding nations -- then let free in to the wilderness. Or killed immediately for the heinous offense. \n\nHinting at possible matrilineal continuity across oceans — this is also consistent with other matrilineal justice mechanisms of Africa. Mentioned by polymath, physicist, anthropologist, archaeologist, linguist, historian —Cheikh Anta Diop. Diop describes precolonial west African nations having intricate protocols for bringing local/regional rule benders into the family for a determined period of time —after which it was then illegal to ever disparage the person by even mentioning the crime or this time of the person’s life. \n\nThis last nuance actually points to elaborate cultural protections against free labor —as does clan adoption via “bringing into the heart fire” in the native context. \n\nChattel slavery is largely dependent on quite the contrary elaborate cultural mechanisms of dehumanization — rhetoric of infidels was just as pop culture as minstrel shows, toys, cartoons food labels &amp; children restaurants called “Little Black Sambo” as recent as the 80s here in the states for example. These indigenous systems seem to be humanizing as much as possible with protections against dehumanization.\n\nThis makes lot more sense than this “heart fire” phrasing being a sick euphemism for what is the Islamic origin of chattel slavery ,in which we are the most familiar in the west. As Graeber mentions the folks in the 1500s having a hard time believing natives had even heard of Jesus let alone (or practice human sacrifice to demons) denounce him. This may be a continuation of this same phenomenon via the slavery misnomer that is rooted in old world religious, political &amp; economic systems. Far removed from a precolonial native world. \n\n“The forgotten slave trade” of east Africa &amp; what was then — extensions of these east African nations into the Middle East. Resulted in an ethnic cleansing not unlike what has happened in modern Palestine in our lifetime. It also lasted long enough to overlap with the west African slave trade. \nNot unlike our real time awareness of geopolitics today, important history of both eras of African slavery are largely lost to highly politicized &amp; or religious narratives, somehow skipping over indigenous spiritual/cultural influence in the regions for millenia. Diop mentions interesting west African context often left out — the “bringing into the heart fire” style justice systems were still intact in these still precolonial black African nations — this was exploited by slave traders before raids became necessary because these nations rose to the defense of their people after discovering the crime. \n\nNone of this takes away from Graeber’s overall point of empirical political data over millenia giving robust design to political systems of the hemisphere. The details here merely add to the importance of Graeber’s work &amp; due diligence in this area of study — work virtually unprecedented in his peers past or present. These details are also likely derivatives of the formulaic aspect of indigenous modes of social organization — explaining the cultural continuity in respective hemispheres. All distinct cultures of course but also self similar like the coast lines themselves, through common cosmological significations expressing beautiful social resilience in diversity. \n\nGraeber is also spot on in another remarkable and extremely relevant way for those of us here in this cohort together. Wage slavery is another kind of slavery we are familiar with — and this is where there is some actual real independent cultural overlap! The pre-colonial Five Nations Longhouse Confederacy was on the brink of falling into perpetual cycles of wage based slavery similar but likely also distinct from modern industrialized systems. \n\nThis is oral documentation of nations coming out of war and into peace 2.5k yrs ago. Wampum shells for the beads on strings of sinew that was used for trade; were becoming commodified. Not from old world systems of settler colonial extraction &amp; military market creation of course; the shells were becoming commodified by default of nations at war. War meant it simply wasn’t safe to collect these shells from the lakes. War eventually created a corrupted mind that was content to have others work for them via control of these shells. This mind was successfully transformed with matrilineal council that protected long term, against male dominant commodification of all strains of life — this lasted up until colonization. \n\nThe League of Peace formed 2.5k yrs ago out of this empirical data matched with even older formulaic design that goes back to Sky Woman herself. This is a beautiful precedent that is desperately needed in these times. And Graeber’s words truly become prophetic in this context. @cryptowanderer @Vivek Singh @Magenta Ceiba @Sparrow Read",

You folks are amazing and your help instrumental.\n\nOther fellows, always positive, helpful and inspiring in the best way possible even while busy with their own adventures, like @Simon Fremaux, @Carl Farterson and the best-practices gang, @Holly Grimm, and the DADA team, even if we didn't interact much directly, know you've been an inspiration for many years!\n\nAnd how can we not be grateful for the Kernel team, receiving us all with open arms and unparalleled patience and kindness, @Sachin Mittal, @Vivek Singh and others, one-of-a-kind human beings which I'm honoured to have met and spend time with. :pray:\n\nLastly, I can't write this without a special note to @cryptowanderer, embracing the project mission from the start, contributing in ways I couldn't have expected, making what the project is today a reality, you're amazing, thank you again.\n\nOne can say riding a market like we're experiencing today as a solo builder with a somewhat market-fit product can feel like choosing Jaws, Maui as a go-to surf spot while still learning to surf, sure some can pull off the once-in-a-lifetime herculean task of achieving so alone...But what enables surfers to, time and time again, execute this impressive feat, a humbling celebration of our ability to face head-first the scariest challenges posed by nature, are exactly other humans, community, supporters often not celebrated, from the tow-in jet sky riders, the lifeguards bringing you oxygen, to the chanting crowd by the coast and even the sharks keeping you alert.\n\nBack to the point, what is being done here at Kernel is unique, every step planned with a level of care hard to find elsewhere, and it is also upon us all to keep this flame awake and the kernel culture principled, I hope to in the future be able to help others the same way I was helped here, for that is what makes the world go round.\n\nFor now, thank you Kernel, for all, and happy spring! :seedling:",

You helped me form a “we” instead of a “me, the lone nut”, and that has made all the difference.\n@Lauren Nignon*,* you had the empathy to recognise something in me, encouraged my craziness and made me feel welcomed. \n@Petr Porobov, you are so crazy and passionate about Upala, that you made me feel like I’m home in this setting.\n@Samuel Tang, your interest in the idea and the offer to contribute to Agadom assured us that we are on the right track.\n\n@cryptowanderer Thank you for the flashlight.",

Marc is a swiss dance curator that has been a driving force for Zurichs queer alternative and underground performance scene, having curated Zurich Moves for the last 7 years ! This is part of the idea of my Junto, to bring speakers from different artistic and production contexts and understand from the experienced voice what is at fault in the systems we have available right now, so that we can better them, if not totally changing them :heart:\nand some food for thought on this sunday :heart: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_without_organs>",

You folks are amazing and your help instrumental.\n\nOther fellows, always positive, helpful and inspiring in the best way possible even while busy with their own adventures, like @Simon Fremaux, @Carl Farterson and the best-practices gang, @Holly Grimm, and the DADA team, even if we didn't interact much directly, know you've been an inspiration for many years!\n\nAnd how can we not be grateful for the Kernel team, receiving us all with open arms and unparalleled patience and kindness, @Sachin Mittal, @Vivek Singh and others, one-of-a-kind human beings which I'm honoured to have met and spend time with. :pray:\n\nLastly, I can't write this without a special note to @cryptowanderer, embracing the project mission from the start, contributing in ways I couldn't have expected, making what the project is today a reality, you're amazing, thank you again.\n\nOne can say riding a market like we're experiencing today as a solo builder with a somewhat market-fit product can feel like choosing Jaws, Maui as a go-to surf spot while still learning to surf, sure some can pull off the once-in-a-lifetime herculean task of achieving so alone...But what enables surfers to, time and time again, execute this impressive feat, a humbling celebration of our ability to face head-first the scariest challenges posed by nature, are exactly other humans, community, supporters often not celebrated, from the tow-in jet sky riders, the lifeguards bringing you oxygen, to the chanting crowd by the coast and even the sharks keeping you alert.\n\nBack to the point, what is being done here at Kernel is unique, every step planned with a level of care hard to find elsewhere, and it is also upon us all to keep this flame awake and the kernel culture principled, I hope to in the future be able to help others the same way I was helped here, for that is what makes the world go round.\n\nFor now, thank you Kernel, for all, and happy spring! :seedling:",

Marc is a swiss dance curator that has been a driving force for Zurichs queer alternative and underground performance scene, having curated Zurich Moves for the last 7 years ! This is part of the idea of my Junto, to bring speakers from different artistic and production contexts and understand from the experienced voice what is at fault in the systems we have available right now, so that we can better them, if not totally changing them :heart:\nand some food for thought on this sunday :heart: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_without_organs>",

The intention was just get together, geek out on all things decarbonising web 3 &amp; leveraging things like DeFi to accelerate the vision of a planet positive, carbon negative future for all including jamming on things like the devastation faced by our oceans in example.\n\nIf you missed it, don't worry, you can find the recording in <#C01UUEDM934|feed-session-recordings> but essentially we spent a lot of time on intros &amp; getting to know each other better which was lovely, had some climate convo led by @Raphael Haupt &amp; some others, deciding that essentially we would co-ord in <#C01KHR1M0LA|jam-climate> &amp; find a time that suited all of us as best as possible to make the event a reoccurring thing.\n\nThanks to all the fantastic people &amp; minds that attended @Abe Uccello @Ben Lakoff @Holly Grimm @Raphael Haupt @Kevin Davis @Laurens De Poorter @Robin Roy Thomas.  Sorry to the people I've missed, had some difficulty finding your Slack @. Please DM me so can add you to the thread if you see this! :slightly_smiling_face:\n\n#CLIMATEGANG",

Marc is a swiss dance curator that has been a driving force for Zurichs queer alternative and underground performance scene, having curated Zurich Moves for the last 7 years ! This is part of the idea of my Junto, to bring speakers from different artistic and production contexts and understand from the experienced voice what is at fault in the systems we have available right now, so that we can better them, if not totally changing them :heart:\nand some food for thought on this sunday :heart: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_without_organs>",
