Thanks for letting me cry in Twitter Spaces today @Vivek Singh @alisha @Angela Gilhotra @cryptowanderer @Sachin Mittal. In KB4, I've bonded, spent time with or been in the presence with these amazingly inspirational womxn of color @Vienna Looi @Songyi Lee @Holly Grimm @Jasmine Wang @Michelle Ma @Denise Schaefer @Rebecca Mqamelo @Juanna Zhai. I've been so moved by the work of @Richard Blythman @Matthew Scott Jones that I hope for the future of the “metaverse” and AI, places where I have felt trapped in centralized recreating inequalities for so long, that it's such a fresh breathe of air to see these amazing founders for their work and I can't wait to see more from them and work with them somehow in some fashion at the intersection as its relevant with my work in the future. I have an extremely long list of all the folks who demo’ed today at Showcase and Expo that I either plan on somehow integrating into in my future work (be a user, beta tester, adviser on their platform). Thank you (Salamat) again to @Alex Yao Lisa Lee Lucas (co-founder of NOVA with @Nicolas Nicolas Ponette) and Michelle Tsing (laptopradio and blockchain adviser to some companies out of Kernel and Blockchain at Berkeley accelerator) for pushing me to apply. I almost didn't and I am so glad I did. It is really encouraging me to do all the things I want to with DAOs, to not compromise my values, and stay true to myself, in a world obsessed with performative isms that is the Hollywood/Silicon Valley/DC/NY power and wealth hungry addicted and controlling egos that I try so hard to resist. Today I quit 3 social media networks, dropped 3 projects that no longer made sense, and am deciding to double down on what I believe is authentic to my nature and being, that will continue to serve me well personally and professionally in my work. Thank you so much for helping me verbally process, grow, raise hard and contentious questions and receive so many more resources and feedback I am still processing I feel like I did 5 MOOCs and a degrrr in Kernel it was far more than I expected than a YC, graduate degree, or self-help coaching session. This has been powerful for me as a community organizer, entrepreneur, software engineer, computational designer, as a woman of color, colonized person, and avid reader. I so appreciate all the hard work it takes to create content, organize logistics, moderate, facilitate, and maintain as a steward and also much love to every single person in the Kernel community who has been responsive with every chat, every request, and every ask I have made whether verbal, written or otherwise. I am constantly amazed by this community and am so privileged to be a part of it. It's been an honor to be selected as a fellow and I can only hope I live up to what I set out to do next now with a framework that helps heal me and keep me grounded away from a hamster wheel that is life. I am taking a major cooling period after December and hope to share more work come 2022 with Kernel (maybe a future showcase), of all that's been incubating and cooking up in my head, behind Code editors and things I haven't pushed to GitHub, announced or made live yet. Lastly, thank you @Kevin Owocki for founding GitCoin, seeing you speak at Dystopia Labs and other conferences over the years always impressed me and I'm floored to have participated somehow in some small way related remotely to the work that you do, it is so important for the liberation of all people in the world and I hope that it continues to evolve with each Kernel block in the future.","by":"Erin Pangilinan"},{"message":"I am simply grateful for the wonderful fellows I have met from all around the world!

You folks are amazing and your help instrumental.\n\nOther fellows, always positive, helpful and inspiring in the best way possible even while busy with their own adventures, like @Simon Fremaux, @Carl Farterson and the best-practices gang, @Holly Grimm, and the DADA team, even if we didn't interact much directly, know you've been an inspiration for many years!\n\nAnd how can we not be grateful for the Kernel team, receiving us all with open arms and unparalleled patience and kindness, @Sachin Mittal, @Vivek Singh and others, one-of-a-kind human beings which I'm honoured to have met and spend time with. :pray:\n\nLastly, I can't write this without a special note to @cryptowanderer, embracing the project mission from the start, contributing in ways I couldn't have expected, making what the project is today a reality, you're amazing, thank you again.\n\nOne can say riding a market like we're experiencing today as a solo builder with a somewhat market-fit product can feel like choosing Jaws, Maui as a go-to surf spot while still learning to surf, sure some can pull off the once-in-a-lifetime herculean task of achieving so alone...But what enables surfers to, time and time again, execute this impressive feat, a humbling celebration of our ability to face head-first the scariest challenges posed by nature, are exactly other humans, community, supporters often not celebrated, from the tow-in jet sky riders, the lifeguards bringing you oxygen, to the chanting crowd by the coast and even the sharks keeping you alert.\n\nBack to the point, what is being done here at Kernel is unique, every step planned with a level of care hard to find elsewhere, and it is also upon us all to keep this flame awake and the kernel culture principled, I hope to in the future be able to help others the same way I was helped here, for that is what makes the world go round.\n\nFor now, thank you Kernel, for all, and happy spring! :seedling:","by":"Adrian le Bas"},{"message":"I want to share my huge thanks to the gitcoin team and everyone I have spoken to along the way especially @Vivek Singh @Sachin Mittal.

The team has learned a lot these past few days.","by":"Irvin Cardenas"},{"message":"This is a message of gratitude to @Kris Is, who showed up at CICOLAB yesterday and gave us some great advice to check out Dandelion Mané and Source Cred. This actually was not necessarily an obvious link, because Source Cred has been coming at their solution from \"reputation,\" and we have been talking about \"matching.\" (See here for a history of this idea: <https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lYxOK30=/>). If you watch this <https://youtu.be/Ee99RK5_Jtg|condensed video (6 min)> of last night's discussion, you can see an example of what we call \"discoverability,\" which is huge problem within Kernel. This is because it is a highly innovative space, with high diversity of people from different backgrounds. That means that people might be working on different projects which might actually align in some way, but that is difficult to see on the surface (in other words, they would not be able to find each other using Google because of non-obvious search terms and lack of common language between different fields, or by simply listing what their project is about).  It takes a deeper dive into figuring out the \"why\" of what people are trying to do with their projects. So, thanks, Kris, for taking that time and making a really great connection which saved me so much work. You are a lifesaver.\n\nIn last night's session, we talked about Appreciation Bytes, our super-simple tool for noticing the often-invisible contributions of others which add to group intelligence. Our hypothesis is that we could use this to facilitate matching between a mess of groups, people, and projects, especially in a community-wide funding effort. It turns out that we have been working on the front end to what Source Cred has been developing the back end, and there is probably a high incidence of that in Kernel. Developing the machine and human technology to be able to put the memetic puzzles pieces together is a fascinating mission and one we look forward to helping to solve during our time at Kernel. @Sachin Mittal @Vivek Singh @Charles Blass","by":"Lauren Nignon"},{"message":"This was great!

I cannot believe Kernel is already over. It was sometimes tough for me to participate due to time zones but I tried to make it work the best it could. Like others, it meant that I missed some pretty interesting discussions but I was happy to listen to recordings later. It was 'tough' to work through Kernel with a hardware project, especially seeing the heavy ETH focus (in a good way)! It was fun nonetheless and got some feedback I still have to work through. As an upside, we recently applied for a grant to take the first steps into taking int into production. We aim to incorporate in Singapore due to logistic and strategic reasons, as our researched showed that Asia is the fastest growing hardware market. I talked and received feedback from many people, and for that you have my thanks! To all the others I did not get a chance to talk, perhaps we see each other in a next round. I will stick around in these Slack channels for as long as they continue to exist. I debated joining APOLLO but with some of the stuff coming up, it is too much to manage. I'd love to keep in touch or if anyone wants to reach out and join the fun. Interested in talking to people from all backgrounds. Also, we are open to investment opportunities. Cheers all!

In KB4, I've bonded, spent time with or been in the presence with these amazingly inspirational womxn of color @Vienna Looi @Songyi Lee @Holly Grimm @Jasmine Wang @Michelle Ma @Denise Schaefer @Rebecca Mqamelo @Juanna Zhai. I've been so moved by the work of @Richard Blythman @Matthew Scott Jones that I hope for the future of the “metaverse” and AI, places where I have felt trapped in centralized recreating inequalities for so long, that it's such a fresh breathe of air to see these amazing founders for their work and I can't wait to see more from them and work with them somehow in some fashion at the intersection as its relevant with my work in the future. I have an extremely long list of all the folks who demo’ed today at Showcase and Expo that I either plan on somehow integrating into in my future work (be a user, beta tester, adviser on their platform). Thank you (Salamat) again to @Alex Yao Lisa Lee Lucas (co-founder of NOVA with @Nicolas Nicolas Ponette) and Michelle Tsing (laptopradio and blockchain adviser to some companies out of Kernel and Blockchain at Berkeley accelerator) for pushing me to apply. I almost didn't and I am so glad I did. It is really encouraging me to do all the things I want to with DAOs, to not compromise my values, and stay true to myself, in a world obsessed with performative isms that is the Hollywood/Silicon Valley/DC/NY power and wealth hungry addicted and controlling egos that I try so hard to resist. Today I quit 3 social media networks, dropped 3 projects that no longer made sense, and am deciding to double down on what I believe is authentic to my nature and being, that will continue to serve me well personally and professionally in my work. Thank you so much for helping me verbally process, grow, raise hard and contentious questions and receive so many more resources and feedback I am still processing I feel like I did 5 MOOCs and a degrrr in Kernel it was far more than I expected than a YC, graduate degree, or self-help coaching session. This has been powerful for me as a community organizer, entrepreneur, software engineer, computational designer, as a woman of color, colonized person, and avid reader. I so appreciate all the hard work it takes to create content, organize logistics, moderate, facilitate, and maintain as a steward and also much love to every single person in the Kernel community who has been responsive with every chat, every request, and every ask I have made whether verbal, written or otherwise. I am constantly amazed by this community and am so privileged to be a part of it. It's been an honor to be selected as a fellow and I can only hope I live up to what I set out to do next now with a framework that helps heal me and keep me grounded away from a hamster wheel that is life. I am taking a major cooling period after December and hope to share more work come 2022 with Kernel (maybe a future showcase), of all that's been incubating and cooking up in my head, behind Code editors and things I haven't pushed to GitHub, announced or made live yet. Lastly, thank you @Kevin Owocki for founding GitCoin, seeing you speak at Dystopia Labs and other conferences over the years always impressed me and I'm floored to have participated somehow in some small way related remotely to the work that you do, it is so important for the liberation of all people in the world and I hope that it continues to evolve with each Kernel block in the future.","by":"Erin Pangilinan"},{"message":"Wow, is all I can say.

His great articulation of the benefits of consensus &amp; the creation of new bottom up structures-- seems to speak to where the weight of transformative power of indigenous dialogue resides. Not having to start from scratch in autonomous creation of new sustainable structures is a huge advantage we shouldn’t take for granted on any front.\n\nInsights to western misnomers of indigenous social structures through a matrilineal indigenous &amp; _Kanienke'ha'ka perspective (misnomer - Mohawk)_: \n\nFemale/Male Chief = “The Best of us”-- chosen by women title-holders with 100% consensus decision making. “(De)horned” by women when deemed ineligible for title. No campaigns or elections, to avoid any “perception of corruption.” Perceptions of possible pillow talk amongst representatives means title-holders can not be married to each other for example.\n\nHereditary - Is reference to clan —not blood, or immediate family. Used as mechanism to protect against nepotism or any “perceptions of corruption,” not to ensure nepotism as in the western context. Even if not blood &amp; across the territory for example— inter clan marriage is illegal. Representatives can not hand down title to their children-- as in the western meaning of hereditary monarchies. Clan is blood only in the case that legally clan can only be given by mother to children. If your mother is does not have a clan but your father does you are his  “__” clan “hung about the neck.” This becomes relevant in case of legal title eligibility. \n\nElected Tribal or Band councils across the hemisphere today do not abide by any of these native constitution laws —their chief title only being legal in context of municipalities of respective colonial nations — which means they have signed away their rightful nation to nation status of the Two Row Wampum Peace Treaty. We can never express our gratitude to the women of the Longhouse in Kahnawake, who have kept this Peace Treaty alive for us to leverage today. \n\nSlavery - The Longhouse is adamant about the absence of slavery in the hemisphere. The Longhouse is also always careful not to speak on the protocols of other native nations. So this strong stance on slavery is likely a reference to the continuity that also exist amongst those distinctions—from a common history &amp; cosmology “the journey of the corn.”\n\nThis is consistent with the Longhouse’s oral documentation of “the bringing into the heart fire” concept of indigenous ”justice systems.” Hereditary in the indigenous context becomes important in Wengrow’s mention of “hereditary slavery”--because it likely points to an adoption into clan mechanism, merely getting lost in an ethnographic translation. To jail or imprison a human being in Longhouse oral documentation has always been illegal. So it follows that anything even closely resembling the chattel style slavery we attach to the word would inherently be deemed illegal as well. The worst of crimes meant being marked on the face as the worst of offenders, to be easily identified by surrounding nations -- then let free in to the wilderness. Or killed immediately for the heinous offense. \n\nHinting at possible matrilineal continuity across oceans — this is also consistent with other matrilineal justice mechanisms of Africa. Mentioned by polymath, physicist, anthropologist, archaeologist, linguist, historian —Cheikh Anta Diop. Diop describes precolonial west African nations having intricate protocols for bringing local/regional rule benders into the family for a determined period of time —after which it was then illegal to ever disparage the person by even mentioning the crime or this time of the person’s life. \n\nThis last nuance actually points to elaborate cultural protections against free labor —as does clan adoption via “bringing into the heart fire” in the native context. \n\nChattel slavery is largely dependent on quite the contrary elaborate cultural mechanisms of dehumanization — rhetoric of infidels was just as pop culture as minstrel shows, toys, cartoons food labels &amp; children restaurants called “Little Black Sambo” as recent as the 80s here in the states for example. These indigenous systems seem to be humanizing as much as possible with protections against dehumanization.\n\nThis makes lot more sense than this “heart fire” phrasing being a sick euphemism for what is the Islamic origin of chattel slavery ,in which we are the most familiar in the west. As Graeber mentions the folks in the 1500s having a hard time believing natives had even heard of Jesus let alone (or practice human sacrifice to demons) denounce him. This may be a continuation of this same phenomenon via the slavery misnomer that is rooted in old world religious, political &amp; economic systems. Far removed from a precolonial native world. \n\n“The forgotten slave trade” of east Africa &amp; what was then — extensions of these east African nations into the Middle East. Resulted in an ethnic cleansing not unlike what has happened in modern Palestine in our lifetime. It also lasted long enough to overlap with the west African slave trade. \nNot unlike our real time awareness of geopolitics today, important history of both eras of African slavery are largely lost to highly politicized &amp; or religious narratives, somehow skipping over indigenous spiritual/cultural influence in the regions for millenia. Diop mentions interesting west African context often left out — the “bringing into the heart fire” style justice systems were still intact in these still precolonial black African nations — this was exploited by slave traders before raids became necessary because these nations rose to the defense of their people after discovering the crime. \n\nNone of this takes away from Graeber’s overall point of empirical political data over millenia giving robust design to political systems of the hemisphere. The details here merely add to the importance of Graeber’s work &amp; due diligence in this area of study — work virtually unprecedented in his peers past or present. These details are also likely derivatives of the formulaic aspect of indigenous modes of social organization — explaining the cultural continuity in respective hemispheres. All distinct cultures of course but also self similar like the coast lines themselves, through common cosmological significations expressing beautiful social resilience in diversity. \n\nGraeber is also spot on in another remarkable and extremely relevant way for those of us here in this cohort together. Wage slavery is another kind of slavery we are familiar with — and this is where there is some actual real independent cultural overlap! The pre-colonial Five Nations Longhouse Confederacy was on the brink of falling into perpetual cycles of wage based slavery similar but likely also distinct from modern industrialized systems. \n\nThis is oral documentation of nations coming out of war and into peace 2.5k yrs ago. Wampum shells for the beads on strings of sinew that was used for trade; were becoming commodified. Not from old world systems of settler colonial extraction &amp; military market creation of course; the shells were becoming commodified by default of nations at war. War meant it simply wasn’t safe to collect these shells from the lakes. War eventually created a corrupted mind that was content to have others work for them via control of these shells. This mind was successfully transformed with matrilineal council that protected long term, against male dominant commodification of all strains of life — this lasted up until colonization. \n\nThe League of Peace formed 2.5k yrs ago out of this empirical data matched with even older formulaic design that goes back to Sky Woman herself. This is a beautiful precedent that is desperately needed in these times. And Graeber’s words truly become prophetic in this context. @cryptowanderer @Vivek Singh @Magenta Ceiba @Sparrow Read","by":"Harold Davis"},{"message":"Ty kindly for all this feedback!

This actually was not necessarily an obvious link, because Source Cred has been coming at their solution from \"reputation,\" and we have been talking about \"matching.\" (See here for a history of this idea: <https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lYxOK30=/>). If you watch this <https://youtu.be/Ee99RK5_Jtg|condensed video (6 min)> of last night's discussion, you can see an example of what we call \"discoverability,\" which is huge problem within Kernel. This is because it is a highly innovative space, with high diversity of people from different backgrounds. That means that people might be working on different projects which might actually align in some way, but that is difficult to see on the surface (in other words, they would not be able to find each other using Google because of non-obvious search terms and lack of common language between different fields, or by simply listing what their project is about).  It takes a deeper dive into figuring out the \"why\" of what people are trying to do with their projects. So, thanks, Kris, for taking that time and making a really great connection which saved me so much work. You are a lifesaver.\n\nIn last night's session, we talked about Appreciation Bytes, our super-simple tool for noticing the often-invisible contributions of others which add to group intelligence. Our hypothesis is that we could use this to facilitate matching between a mess of groups, people, and projects, especially in a community-wide funding effort. It turns out that we have been working on the front end to what Source Cred has been developing the back end, and there is probably a high incidence of that in Kernel. Developing the machine and human technology to be able to put the memetic puzzles pieces together is a fascinating mission and one we look forward to helping to solve during our time at Kernel. @Sachin Mittal @Vivek Singh @Charles Blass","by":"Lauren Nignon"},{"message":"@Dandelion -- @Kris Is mentioned you're looking to test.... <http://cicolab.org|cicolab.org> definitely interested, ready :slightly_smiling_face:\nthx @Vivek Singh!  + @Angela Gilhotra, ears open","by":"Charles Blass"},{"message":"@Vivek Singh Yes!

I cannot believe Kernel is already over. It was sometimes tough for me to participate due to time zones but I tried to make it work the best it could. Like others, it meant that I missed some pretty interesting discussions but I was happy to listen to recordings later. It was 'tough' to work through Kernel with a hardware project, especially seeing the heavy ETH focus (in a good way)! It was fun nonetheless and got some feedback I still have to work through. As an upside, we recently applied for a grant to take the first steps into taking int into production. We aim to incorporate in Singapore due to logistic and strategic reasons, as our researched showed that Asia is the fastest growing hardware market. I talked and received feedback from many people, and for that you have my thanks! To all the others I did not get a chance to talk, perhaps we see each other in a next round. I will stick around in these Slack channels for as long as they continue to exist. I debated joining APOLLO but with some of the stuff coming up, it is too much to manage.

You folks are amazing and your help instrumental.\n\nOther fellows, always positive, helpful and inspiring in the best way possible even while busy with their own adventures, like @Simon Fremaux, @Carl Farterson and the best-practices gang, @Holly Grimm, and the DADA team, even if we didn't interact much directly, know you've been an inspiration for many years!\n\nAnd how can we not be grateful for the Kernel team, receiving us all with open arms and unparalleled patience and kindness, @Sachin Mittal, @Vivek Singh and others, one-of-a-kind human beings which I'm honoured to have met and spend time with. :pray:\n\nLastly, I can't write this without a special note to @cryptowanderer, embracing the project mission from the start, contributing in ways I couldn't have expected, making what the project is today a reality, you're amazing, thank you again.\n\nOne can say riding a market like we're experiencing today as a solo builder with a somewhat market-fit product can feel like choosing Jaws, Maui as a go-to surf spot while still learning to surf, sure some can pull off the once-in-a-lifetime herculean task of achieving so alone...But what enables surfers to, time and time again, execute this impressive feat, a humbling celebration of our ability to face head-first the scariest challenges posed by nature, are exactly other humans, community, supporters often not celebrated, from the tow-in jet sky riders, the lifeguards bringing you oxygen, to the chanting crowd by the coast and even the sharks keeping you alert.\n\nBack to the point, what is being done here at Kernel is unique, every step planned with a level of care hard to find elsewhere, and it is also upon us all to keep this flame awake and the kernel culture principled, I hope to in the future be able to help others the same way I was helped here, for that is what makes the world go round.\n\nFor now, thank you Kernel, for all, and happy spring! :seedling:","by":"Adrian le Bas"},{"message":"So many people to thank here, I’d like to express gratitude towards people that keep this community alive. \n@Vivek Singh: for hosting weekly sessions, mentorship, connecting us with wonderful people in this space and for being a friend. \n@Sachin Mittal: for intros, office hours, resources and your support to our project. \n@Holly Grimm: for guiding us to build generative artwork, supporting Coinvise and working on an impactful project.\n@cryptowanderer: Your thoughts on building communities, blue book and ideas inspire me. \n@Harsh Rajat: for helping us setup Coinvise and supporting us all the way\n@Zayi Reyes, @christina, @Mekyle Naidoo @Alexander Yoseph, @pet3rpan and many more.

My web3 journey didn't start with Kernel but it did start with Gitcoin back in early 2019 after I heard a podcast with @Kevin Owocki that was my first step down the rabbit hole.  After hacking away on bounties for more than year (quite a few for Gitcoin Core), I saw the first mentions of the Kernel program and applied.  After a fruitful interview with @Vivek Singh and @Sachin Mittal, I waited a few weeks and wondered if I'd ever hear back.  I feel like the poster child for imposter syndrome in the web3 world and I was more than surprised when I got the email inviting me to join the Kernel Genesis Block.  The rest, as they say, is history.  I'm thankful for having been included in this community of builders and thinkers and also for the whole Gitcoin community of growing open source .  I'm definitely not the deepest thinker here or the best coder (not by a country mile), but it was this community that really helped me find my footing to go from where I was (someone who felt purposeless and unfruitful in my then vocation) to where I am now (an active, engaged dev working on Ethereum infrastructure who wakes up every day excited to do what I've been called to do and to see the world get turned upside down by what we're building).  So thank you @Kevin Owocki for building Gitcoin, @Vivek Singh, @Sachin Mittal,  and@cryptowanderer for Kernel, and to others along the way who have given me opportunities to build cool stuff and to be a part of web3 like @Rob Secord and @Ben Lakoff from Charged Particles, @Mike Elias from Idea Market, various folks from the Status/Nimbus team, @Shresth Agrawal, @Jose Aguinaga...etc.","by":"acolytec3"}],"count":1},"attributes":[{"trait_type":"award","value":"Keys to the Castle"},{"trait_type":"testimonial","value":"Dearest Jose.

Thanks for letting me cry in Twitter Spaces today @Vivek Singh @alisha @Angela Gilhotra @cryptowanderer @Sachin Mittal. In KB4, I've bonded, spent time with or been in the presence with these amazingly inspirational womxn of color @Vienna Looi @Songyi Lee @Holly Grimm @Jasmine Wang @Michelle Ma @Denise Schaefer @Rebecca Mqamelo @Juanna Zhai. I've been so moved by the work of @Richard Blythman @Matthew Scott Jones that I hope for the future of the “metaverse” and AI, places where I have felt trapped in centralized recreating inequalities for so long, that it's such a fresh breathe of air to see these amazing founders for their work and I can't wait to see more from them and work with them somehow in some fashion at the intersection as its relevant with my work in the future. I have an extremely long list of all the folks who demo’ed today at Showcase and Expo that I either plan on somehow integrating into in my future work (be a user, beta tester, adviser on their platform). Thank you (Salamat) again to @Alex Yao Lisa Lee Lucas (co-founder of NOVA with @Nicolas Nicolas Ponette) and Michelle Tsing (laptopradio and blockchain adviser to some companies out of Kernel and Blockchain at Berkeley accelerator) for pushing me to apply. I almost didn't and I am so glad I did. It is really encouraging me to do all the things I want to with DAOs, to not compromise my values, and stay true to myself, in a world obsessed with performative isms that is the Hollywood/Silicon Valley/DC/NY power and wealth hungry addicted and controlling egos that I try so hard to resist. Today I quit 3 social media networks, dropped 3 projects that no longer made sense, and am deciding to double down on what I believe is authentic to my nature and being, that will continue to serve me well personally and professionally in my work. Thank you so much for helping me verbally process, grow, raise hard and contentious questions and receive so many more resources and feedback I am still processing I feel like I did 5 MOOCs and a degrrr in Kernel it was far more than I expected than a YC, graduate degree, or self-help coaching session. This has been powerful for me as a community organizer, entrepreneur, software engineer, computational designer, as a woman of color, colonized person, and avid reader. I so appreciate all the hard work it takes to create content, organize logistics, moderate, facilitate, and maintain as a steward and also much love to every single person in the Kernel community who has been responsive with every chat, every request, and every ask I have made whether verbal, written or otherwise. I am constantly amazed by this community and am so privileged to be a part of it. It's been an honor to be selected as a fellow and I can only hope I live up to what I set out to do next now with a framework that helps heal me and keep me grounded away from a hamster wheel that is life. I am taking a major cooling period after December and hope to share more work come 2022 with Kernel (maybe a future showcase), of all that's been incubating and cooking up in my head, behind Code editors and things I haven't pushed to GitHub, announced or made live yet. Lastly, thank you @Kevin Owocki for founding GitCoin, seeing you speak at Dystopia Labs and other conferences over the years always impressed me and I'm floored to have participated somehow in some small way related remotely to the work that you do, it is so important for the liberation of all people in the world and I hope that it continues to evolve with each Kernel block in the future.","by":"Erin Pangilinan"},{"message":"Wow, is all I can say.

My web3 journey didn't start with Kernel but it did start with Gitcoin back in early 2019 after I heard a podcast with @Kevin Owocki that was my first step down the rabbit hole.  After hacking away on bounties for more than year (quite a few for Gitcoin Core), I saw the first mentions of the Kernel program and applied.  After a fruitful interview with @Vivek Singh and @Sachin Mittal, I waited a few weeks and wondered if I'd ever hear back.  I feel like the poster child for imposter syndrome in the web3 world and I was more than surprised when I got the email inviting me to join the Kernel Genesis Block.

Powerful notion if so.","by":"Harold Davis"},{"message":"Here are left over thoughts &amp; some notes from our last Junto that may lend to David’s thoughts on indigenous influence in our urgent times. His great articulation of the benefits of consensus &amp; the creation of new bottom up structures-- seems to speak to where the weight of transformative power of indigenous dialogue resides. Not having to start from scratch in autonomous creation of new sustainable structures is a huge advantage we shouldn’t take for granted on any front.\n\nInsights to western misnomers of indigenous social structures through a matrilineal indigenous &amp; _Kanienke'ha'ka perspective (misnomer - Mohawk)_: \n\nFemale/Male Chief = “The Best of us”-- chosen by women title-holders with 100% consensus decision making. “(De)horned” by women when deemed ineligible for title. No campaigns or elections, to avoid any “perception of corruption.” Perceptions of possible pillow talk amongst representatives means title-holders can not be married to each other for example.\n\nHereditary - Is reference to clan —not blood, or immediate family. Used as mechanism to protect against nepotism or any “perceptions of corruption,” not to ensure nepotism as in the western context. Even if not blood &amp; across the territory for example— inter clan marriage is illegal. Representatives can not hand down title to their children-- as in the western meaning of hereditary monarchies. Clan is blood only in the case that legally clan can only be given by mother to children. If your mother is does not have a clan but your father does you are his  “__” clan “hung about the neck.” This becomes relevant in case of legal title eligibility. \n\nElected Tribal or Band councils across the hemisphere today do not abide by any of these native constitution laws —their chief title only being legal in context of municipalities of respective colonial nations — which means they have signed away their rightful nation to nation status of the Two Row Wampum Peace Treaty. We can never express our gratitude to the women of the Longhouse in Kahnawake, who have kept this Peace Treaty alive for us to leverage today. \n\nSlavery - The Longhouse is adamant about the absence of slavery in the hemisphere. The Longhouse is also always careful not to speak on the protocols of other native nations. So this strong stance on slavery is likely a reference to the continuity that also exist amongst those distinctions—from a common history &amp; cosmology “the journey of the corn.”\n\nThis is consistent with the Longhouse’s oral documentation of “the bringing into the heart fire” concept of indigenous ”justice systems.” Hereditary in the indigenous context becomes important in Wengrow’s mention of “hereditary slavery”--because it likely points to an adoption into clan mechanism, merely getting lost in an ethnographic translation. To jail or imprison a human being in Longhouse oral documentation has always been illegal. So it follows that anything even closely resembling the chattel style slavery we attach to the word would inherently be deemed illegal as well. The worst of crimes meant being marked on the face as the worst of offenders, to be easily identified by surrounding nations -- then let free in to the wilderness. Or killed immediately for the heinous offense. \n\nHinting at possible matrilineal continuity across oceans — this is also consistent with other matrilineal justice mechanisms of Africa. Mentioned by polymath, physicist, anthropologist, archaeologist, linguist, historian —Cheikh Anta Diop. Diop describes precolonial west African nations having intricate protocols for bringing local/regional rule benders into the family for a determined period of time —after which it was then illegal to ever disparage the person by even mentioning the crime or this time of the person’s life. \n\nThis last nuance actually points to elaborate cultural protections against free labor —as does clan adoption via “bringing into the heart fire” in the native context. \n\nChattel slavery is largely dependent on quite the contrary elaborate cultural mechanisms of dehumanization — rhetoric of infidels was just as pop culture as minstrel shows, toys, cartoons food labels &amp; children restaurants called “Little Black Sambo” as recent as the 80s here in the states for example. These indigenous systems seem to be humanizing as much as possible with protections against dehumanization.\n\nThis makes lot more sense than this “heart fire” phrasing being a sick euphemism for what is the Islamic origin of chattel slavery ,in which we are the most familiar in the west. As Graeber mentions the folks in the 1500s having a hard time believing natives had even heard of Jesus let alone (or practice human sacrifice to demons) denounce him. This may be a continuation of this same phenomenon via the slavery misnomer that is rooted in old world religious, political &amp; economic systems. Far removed from a precolonial native world. \n\n“The forgotten slave trade” of east Africa &amp; what was then — extensions of these east African nations into the Middle East. Resulted in an ethnic cleansing not unlike what has happened in modern Palestine in our lifetime. It also lasted long enough to overlap with the west African slave trade. \nNot unlike our real time awareness of geopolitics today, important history of both eras of African slavery are largely lost to highly politicized &amp; or religious narratives, somehow skipping over indigenous spiritual/cultural influence in the regions for millenia. Diop mentions interesting west African context often left out — the “bringing into the heart fire” style justice systems were still intact in these still precolonial black African nations — this was exploited by slave traders before raids became necessary because these nations rose to the defense of their people after discovering the crime. \n\nNone of this takes away from Graeber’s overall point of empirical political data over millenia giving robust design to political systems of the hemisphere. The details here merely add to the importance of Graeber’s work &amp; due diligence in this area of study — work virtually unprecedented in his peers past or present. These details are also likely derivatives of the formulaic aspect of indigenous modes of social organization — explaining the cultural continuity in respective hemispheres. All distinct cultures of course but also self similar like the coast lines themselves, through common cosmological significations expressing beautiful social resilience in diversity. \n\nGraeber is also spot on in another remarkable and extremely relevant way for those of us here in this cohort together. Wage slavery is another kind of slavery we are familiar with — and this is where there is some actual real independent cultural overlap! The pre-colonial Five Nations Longhouse Confederacy was on the brink of falling into perpetual cycles of wage based slavery similar but likely also distinct from modern industrialized systems. \n\nThis is oral documentation of nations coming out of war and into peace 2.5k yrs ago. Wampum shells for the beads on strings of sinew that was used for trade; were becoming commodified. Not from old world systems of settler colonial extraction &amp; military market creation of course; the shells were becoming commodified by default of nations at war. War meant it simply wasn’t safe to collect these shells from the lakes. War eventually created a corrupted mind that was content to have others work for them via control of these shells. This mind was successfully transformed with matrilineal council that protected long term, against male dominant commodification of all strains of life — this lasted up until colonization. \n\nThe League of Peace formed 2.5k yrs ago out of this empirical data matched with even older formulaic design that goes back to Sky Woman herself. This is a beautiful precedent that is desperately needed in these times. And Graeber’s words truly become prophetic in this context. @cryptowanderer @Vivek Singh @Magenta Ceiba @Sparrow Read","by":"Harold Davis"},{"message":"Ty kindly for all this feedback!

Cosmological significations protect against dogmatic tendencies--even if born into dogmatic surroundings &amp; predominant system--by the time one has a lifetime of the numerous matrilineal ceremonies of each 13 moon cycle --the truth reveals herself in the protocols left behind via oral documentation, symbolism &amp; cultural nuances.\nThe 100% consensus being included in the recitation &amp; processes becomes all the more important in this sense as it seems to ensure this truth does not morph into self interested opinion.\nThe capacity for the formation of the League of Peace points to this matrilineal cosmological resilience --the matrilineal decision making process &amp; Onakora creation being fundamental design for the Great Law of Peace &amp; the Two Row Wampum protocols, which grew out of the matrilineal cosmology already in place.\n\nLuckily we saved <https://www.facebook.com/530273387/videos/10156809118613388/|this recording> of Longhouse describing The Four Sacred Ceremonies in a recent council during beginning of new cycle - _not connected to the cycle of the recital linked._ \n\n_Even Stuart's own personal journey points to this--here is recording of Stuart in the <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJ7cuJ8-7fY&amp;list=PLrb8L8Q1cSngGgdI1RBjztMdOGIkstu2E&amp;ab_channel=RaymondStone|90s>. His tone overall is a lot different, Less critical of organized religion too. He is careful not to offend what are likely a lot of his own people watching, who he knows are religious. The Great Law of Peace was even mixed with religious scriptures in the region for example. We also saw the Longhouse rewrite the only written version of the Great Law too, written by quakers. This where we learned a lot of the built in male, western perspective of native culture._\n_Stuart even appeals to religious folk by making analogy of native spirituality prejudice struggles to religious prejudice struggles at one point in the video linked. Something I doubt he'd do today without critical analysis of male dominant, top down dogma.  His personal life choices &amp; transitions from traveling iron worker -- to a dedicated father &amp; devoted voice for his mothers song, when he refused to work on nuclear plant. The life threatening circumstances of retaining nationhood --but above all, his mother's clan mother teachings of not just matrilineal cosmology(dig the moon teachings on same channel too!) but also its protection mechanisms --The Great Law of Peace &amp; Two Row Wampum_ \n\nSo happy to share this all, thanks so much @cryptowanderer for continuing this thread in this unique dialogue!","by":"Harold Davis"},{"message":"&gt; difference between religification and living knowledge.\n@cryptowanderer if we expand here, we should get somewhere exciting it seems haha This is also all completely possible dialogue when you join council of course, to ask the Longhouse directly and get much more profound answers than from myself.

Our matrilineal heritage is being made explicit by the current urgency emitting from our common body of Mother Earth, that our faces yet beneath her, all grow from-- to live together, protecting, healing, and (co)evolving with her, deigning as good minded ancestors of nations that keep their respective ceremonies, forever.:fist::skin-tone-5:","by":"Harold Davis"},{"message":"&gt; Awareness bent back on itself with skill eventually \"disappears\". There is the open field beyond right or wrong. There is 'satori': a sudden and ecstatic insight into the ground of your own being. There is the silence which comes home to stay in a heart that has been emptied of all its images, leaving only the unconditional love which is its nature; its origin and destiny.\n@cryptowanderer Everything said is an eloquent description of the power of recursion unlocked in dialogue &amp; consensus. Above quote sound's like a mother's love. A son's protection of this love &amp; a daughter's ability to regenerate &amp; sustain this love forever. Really dig this <http://revistas.ucm.es/index.php/TEKN/article/view/52267/49998|paper> that posits this:\n\n&gt; Recursion is a big part of recursivity but it is not the whole story. Recursion refers to a system in which  outputs  at one iteration become inputs to the   next. Feedback loops, such as a thermostat regulating temperature in an hour, would be one example. Recursion can also be visualized: self-similar repeating elements  that can be seen when holding a mirror up to another mirror, Russian nesting dolls, the chambers of a nautilus’ shell, and fractal designs like the Sierpinski triangle are all examples of recursion. Recursion is used in a more specific way in computer science, as when a function calls upon itself in order to solve a larger, more complex problem (Hofstadter 1999). \n&gt; Recursion is a powerful concept that has a very specific definition in mathematics and computer science. I have chosen to coin the neologism “recursivity” for two reasons. First, I do not want to instigate debates about whether or not something is “truly” recursive in the mathematical   sense. \n&gt; Recursion is a  conceptual  basis for recursivity in the same way that “equality” is a conceptual basis for democracy; one need not ask how mathematicians define equality to use it. I want to make a clear distinction between the mathematical source material I am drawing from, and the kind of social relations that recursivity promotes. Recursivity is a social condition, not the dutiful execution of a mathematical property. In the same way, a worker that has been scientifically and minutely exploited through computer-aided Taylorism embodies an idea of efficiency, but this is still a far cry from the abstraction of efficiency in physics which might require a frictionless environment, bodies with infinite hardness or other precise idealizations.","by":"Harold Davis"},{"message":"@Sparrow Read @Magenta Ceiba @Bea DADA The Longhouse on <https://youtu.be/cJdqRkqWX6c?t=4381|de)commodification>(one piece of the creation of the league of peace oral history 2k yrs old).

After a fruitful interview with @Vivek Singh and @Sachin Mittal, I waited a few weeks and wondered if I'd ever hear back.  I feel like the poster child for imposter syndrome in the web3 world and I was more than surprised when I got the email inviting me to join the Kernel Genesis Block.  The rest, as they say, is history.  I'm thankful for having been included in this community of builders and thinkers and also for the whole Gitcoin community of growing open source .  I'm definitely not the deepest thinker here or the best coder (not by a country mile), but it was this community that really helped me find my footing to go from where I was (someone who felt purposeless and unfruitful in my then vocation) to where I am now (an active, engaged dev working on Ethereum infrastructure who wakes up every day excited to do what I've been called to do and to see the world get turned upside down by what we're building).  So thank you @Kevin Owocki for building Gitcoin, @Vivek Singh, @Sachin Mittal,  and@cryptowanderer for Kernel, and to others along the way who have given me opportunities to build cool stuff and to be a part of web3 like @Rob Secord and @Ben Lakoff from Charged Particles, @Mike Elias from Idea Market, various folks from the Status/Nimbus team, @Shresth Agrawal, @Jose Aguinaga...etc.","by":"acolytec3"}],"count":1},"attributes":[{"trait_type":"award","value":""},{"trait_type":"testimonial","value":"Shresth -- thank you for your contributions to libp2p and other countless parts of KERNEL.

I mean, everything did in one way or another, but this one particularly felt like there was so much more to unlock to really understand the lessons to be learned here.\n\n`Minding the peace - The League of Peace formed 2,500 years ago as a response to the social climate in North America. The commodification of wampum shells at the time led to the outbreak of war. War meant it simply wasn't safe to collect these shells from the lakes. In the tradition, war is the result of - and perpetuates - a corrupted mind which is content to have others work for it via control and commodification. This mind was successfully transformed by the matrilineal council that protected long term peace, right up until total colonization.`\n\nWhen we commodify things, could it be that this is always the inevitable result? The act of commodification attempts to assign a 'value' to something.  Which works for goods, so they can be exchanged.  But we don't stop there.  When we turn living things, and people, into commodities that can be exchanged (human 'resources' our companies call them) this seems to only ever result in the killing of the thing we have tried to put a 'value' on.\n\nThere are many thing in just this one story that feels to me like important wisdom lost or ignored in much of what we see happening now.","by":"Sparrow Read"},{"message":"@Harold Davis thank you brother :pray: I am beyond grateful for this contribution.

You folks are amazing and your help instrumental.\n\nOther fellows, always positive, helpful and inspiring in the best way possible even while busy with their own adventures, like @Simon Fremaux, @Carl Farterson and the best-practices gang, @Holly Grimm, and the DADA team, even if we didn't interact much directly, know you've been an inspiration for many years!\n\nAnd how can we not be grateful for the Kernel team, receiving us all with open arms and unparalleled patience and kindness, @Sachin Mittal, @Vivek Singh and others, one-of-a-kind human beings which I'm honoured to have met and spend time with. :pray:\n\nLastly, I can't write this without a special note to @cryptowanderer, embracing the project mission from the start, contributing in ways I couldn't have expected, making what the project is today a reality, you're amazing, thank you again.\n\nOne can say riding a market like we're experiencing today as a solo builder with a somewhat market-fit product can feel like choosing Jaws, Maui as a go-to surf spot while still learning to surf, sure some can pull off the once-in-a-lifetime herculean task of achieving so alone...But what enables surfers to, time and time again, execute this impressive feat, a humbling celebration of our ability to face head-first the scariest challenges posed by nature, are exactly other humans, community, supporters often not celebrated, from the tow-in jet sky riders, the lifeguards bringing you oxygen, to the chanting crowd by the coast and even the sharks keeping you alert.\n\nBack to the point, what is being done here at Kernel is unique, every step planned with a level of care hard to find elsewhere, and it is also upon us all to keep this flame awake and the kernel culture principled, I hope to in the future be able to help others the same way I was helped here, for that is what makes the world go round.\n\nFor now, thank you Kernel, for all, and happy spring! :seedling:","by":"Adrian le Bas"},{"message":"Thanks to the Kernel Team, Mentors and awesome fellows.

My web3 journey didn't start with Kernel but it did start with Gitcoin back in early 2019 after I heard a podcast with @Kevin Owocki that was my first step down the rabbit hole.  After hacking away on bounties for more than year (quite a few for Gitcoin Core), I saw the first mentions of the Kernel program and applied.  After a fruitful interview with @Vivek Singh and @Sachin Mittal, I waited a few weeks and wondered if I'd ever hear back.  I feel like the poster child for imposter syndrome in the web3 world and I was more than surprised when I got the email inviting me to join the Kernel Genesis Block.  The rest, as they say, is history.  I'm thankful for having been included in this community of builders and thinkers and also for the whole Gitcoin community of growing open source .  I'm definitely not the deepest thinker here or the best coder (not by a country mile), but it was this community that really helped me find my footing to go from where I was (someone who felt purposeless and unfruitful in my then vocation) to where I am now (an active, engaged dev working on Ethereum infrastructure who wakes up every day excited to do what I've been called to do and to see the world get turned upside down by what we're building).  So thank you @Kevin Owocki for building Gitcoin, @Vivek Singh, @Sachin Mittal,  and@cryptowanderer for Kernel, and to others along the way who have given me opportunities to build cool stuff and to be a part of web3 like @Rob Secord and @Ben Lakoff from Charged Particles, @Mike Elias from Idea Market, various folks from the Status/Nimbus team, @Shresth Agrawal, @Jose Aguinaga...etc.","by":"acolytec3"}],"count":1},"attributes":[{"trait_type":"award","value":""},{"trait_type":"testimonial","value":"Rob -- who would have guessed what might happen after Genesis Block?

My web3 journey didn't start with Kernel but it did start with Gitcoin back in early 2019 after I heard a podcast with @Kevin Owocki that was my first step down the rabbit hole.  After hacking away on bounties for more than year (quite a few for Gitcoin Core), I saw the first mentions of the Kernel program and applied.  After a fruitful interview with @Vivek Singh and @Sachin Mittal, I waited a few weeks and wondered if I'd ever hear back.  I feel like the poster child for imposter syndrome in the web3 world and I was more than surprised when I got the email inviting me to join the Kernel Genesis Block.  The rest, as they say, is history.  I'm thankful for having been included in this community of builders and thinkers and also for the whole Gitcoin community of growing open source .  I'm definitely not the deepest thinker here or the best coder (not by a country mile), but it was this community that really helped me find my footing to go from where I was (someone who felt purposeless and unfruitful in my then vocation) to where I am now (an active, engaged dev working on Ethereum infrastructure who wakes up every day excited to do what I've been called to do and to see the world get turned upside down by what we're building).  So thank you @Kevin Owocki for building Gitcoin, @Vivek Singh, @Sachin Mittal,  and@cryptowanderer for Kernel, and to others along the way who have given me opportunities to build cool stuff and to be a part of web3 like @Rob Secord and @Ben Lakoff from Charged Particles, @Mike Elias from Idea Market, various folks from the Status/Nimbus team, @Shresth Agrawal, @Jose Aguinaga...etc.","by":"acolytec3"},{"message":"I'm so grateful to have been part of KB3 with you !

Thanks for letting me cry in Twitter Spaces today @Vivek Singh @alisha @Angela Gilhotra @cryptowanderer @Sachin Mittal. In KB4, I've bonded, spent time with or been in the presence with these amazingly inspirational womxn of color @Vienna Looi @Songyi Lee @Holly Grimm @Jasmine Wang @Michelle Ma @Denise Schaefer @Rebecca Mqamelo @Juanna Zhai. I've been so moved by the work of @Richard Blythman @Matthew Scott Jones that I hope for the future of the “metaverse” and AI, places where I have felt trapped in centralized recreating inequalities for so long, that it's such a fresh breathe of air to see these amazing founders for their work and I can't wait to see more from them and work with them somehow in some fashion at the intersection as its relevant with my work in the future. I have an extremely long list of all the folks who demo’ed today at Showcase and Expo that I either plan on somehow integrating into in my future work (be a user, beta tester, adviser on their platform). Thank you (Salamat) again to @Alex Yao Lisa Lee Lucas (co-founder of NOVA with @Nicolas Nicolas Ponette) and Michelle Tsing (laptopradio and blockchain adviser to some companies out of Kernel and Blockchain at Berkeley accelerator) for pushing me to apply. I almost didn't and I am so glad I did. It is really encouraging me to do all the things I want to with DAOs, to not compromise my values, and stay true to myself, in a world obsessed with performative isms that is the Hollywood/Silicon Valley/DC/NY power and wealth hungry addicted and controlling egos that I try so hard to resist. Today I quit 3 social media networks, dropped 3 projects that no longer made sense, and am deciding to double down on what I believe is authentic to my nature and being, that will continue to serve me well personally and professionally in my work. Thank you so much for helping me verbally process, grow, raise hard and contentious questions and receive so many more resources and feedback I am still processing I feel like I did 5 MOOCs and a degrrr in Kernel it was far more than I expected than a YC, graduate degree, or self-help coaching session. This has been powerful for me as a community organizer, entrepreneur, software engineer, computational designer, as a woman of color, colonized person, and avid reader. I so appreciate all the hard work it takes to create content, organize logistics, moderate, facilitate, and maintain as a steward and also much love to every single person in the Kernel community who has been responsive with every chat, every request, and every ask I have made whether verbal, written or otherwise. I am constantly amazed by this community and am so privileged to be a part of it. It's been an honor to be selected as a fellow and I can only hope I live up to what I set out to do next now with a framework that helps heal me and keep me grounded away from a hamster wheel that is life. I am taking a major cooling period after December and hope to share more work come 2022 with Kernel (maybe a future showcase), of all that's been incubating and cooking up in my head, behind Code editors and things I haven't pushed to GitHub, announced or made live yet. Lastly, thank you @Kevin Owocki for founding GitCoin, seeing you speak at Dystopia Labs and other conferences over the years always impressed me and I'm floored to have participated somehow in some small way related remotely to the work that you do, it is so important for the liberation of all people in the world and I hope that it continues to evolve with each Kernel block in the future.","by":"Erin Pangilinan"},{"message":"I thought I'd drop a line here as I'm just jumping back into Kernel after quite a time away.  My web3 journey didn't start with Kernel but it did start with Gitcoin back in early 2019 after I heard a podcast with @Kevin Owocki that was my first step down the rabbit hole.  After hacking away on bounties for more than year (quite a few for Gitcoin Core), I saw the first mentions of the Kernel program and applied.  After a fruitful interview with @Vivek Singh and @Sachin Mittal, I waited a few weeks and wondered if I'd ever hear back.

My one thought is about the danger of exclusive focus. That is, while I agree that the ground itself is always experiential, I do think that it must be balanced by some kind of rigor. How to come to this without falling into the trap of a will to power or attempt to control/make legible is my question.

What we're talking about is, in a profound way, far less important than the fact we are talking. That's meta Level 1. First, we develop awareness of awareness. Then, we recognise that the fact we're talking is most critical, but what we are saying is also genuinely important - not in terms of our own opinion, but in terms of seeing ourselves more clearly (i.e. my realisation about synthesis and power was a major moment for me - meta Level 2). Awareness of awareness of awareness. It is this doubly-aware mind which sees that the drive to connect with the other is a part of seeing our own self more clearly: for the more intimate and immediate the connection, the clearer the mirror.\n\nSelf-recursively honing awareness through dialogue, through lived contemplation in honest reflection with others, is a large part of how I experience interactions like this. Awareness bent back on itself with skill eventually \"disappears\". There is the open field beyond right or wrong. There is 'satori': a sudden and ecstatic insight into the ground of your own being. There is the silence which comes home to stay in a heart that has been emptied of all its images, leaving only the unconditional love which is its nature; its origin and destiny.

The following two case studies / pre-reads were recommended and helped aid the lively discussion.\n1. <https://blog.blocknative.com/blog/mempool-forensics|Mempool forensics> :bowl_with_spoon: \n2. <https://www.covalenthq.com/blog/covalent-defi-sdk/|Covalent SDK> :alembic: \nWhile Chris explored the ideas of _value in motion_  :star2:  covering mempool traffic :vertical_traffic_light: analytics and notifications :1234: with us. Ganesh balanced the remaining from where Chris left off by exploring _value at rest_ :cake: with smart-contracts &amp; transactions analytics.\n\nWe also gained valuable insights on historically underlooked mempool data while taking into consideration the performance of the different kinds of nodes in the Ethereum :city_sunset: network including but not limited to how they skew any assumptions on transaction (type) distribution that we might make. Active nonce :1234: and gas price :fuelpump: management for stuck, pending and dropped, mempool transaction :swimmer: and block explorers :building_construction: data stores. We further explored on-chain data usage for delivering insights by restructuring it into a consumable formats while covering topics like EVM  :nerd_face: optimisations, performance considerations in DB latency vs verifiability :checkered_flag: rollups :space_invader: vs single row :table_tennis_paddle_and_ball: lookups, OLTP and OLAP databases, and DB primitives :construction_worker:. The overarching theme was on how we could bridge the legacy DB :steam_locomotive: world onto blockchain :bullettrain_front: and how the technologies we’re building could aid that vision.\n\nEffectively this junto covered the entire spectrum of the happenings in the life of an Ethereum transaction :money_with_wings: and the value that it carries every step of the way. :roller_coaster: I  would highly recommend reaching out to the mentors for anything (even remotely) related to data on blockchain and look forward to our next Junto on one or more of the discussed specifics. @Sachin Mittal thanks a ton for organising this and to all the participants for engaging!

Thanks for letting me cry in Twitter Spaces today @Vivek Singh @alisha @Angela Gilhotra @cryptowanderer @Sachin Mittal. In KB4, I've bonded, spent time with or been in the presence with these amazingly inspirational womxn of color @Vienna Looi @Songyi Lee @Holly Grimm @Jasmine Wang @Michelle Ma @Denise Schaefer @Rebecca Mqamelo @Juanna Zhai. I've been so moved by the work of @Richard Blythman @Matthew Scott Jones that I hope for the future of the “metaverse” and AI, places where I have felt trapped in centralized recreating inequalities for so long, that it's such a fresh breathe of air to see these amazing founders for their work and I can't wait to see more from them and work with them somehow in some fashion at the intersection as its relevant with my work in the future. I have an extremely long list of all the folks who demo’ed today at Showcase and Expo that I either plan on somehow integrating into in my future work (be a user, beta tester, adviser on their platform). Thank you (Salamat) again to @Alex Yao Lisa Lee Lucas (co-founder of NOVA with @Nicolas Nicolas Ponette) and Michelle Tsing (laptopradio and blockchain adviser to some companies out of Kernel and Blockchain at Berkeley accelerator) for pushing me to apply. I almost didn't and I am so glad I did. It is really encouraging me to do all the things I want to with DAOs, to not compromise my values, and stay true to myself, in a world obsessed with performative isms that is the Hollywood/Silicon Valley/DC/NY power and wealth hungry addicted and controlling egos that I try so hard to resist. Today I quit 3 social media networks, dropped 3 projects that no longer made sense, and am deciding to double down on what I believe is authentic to my nature and being, that will continue to serve me well personally and professionally in my work. Thank you so much for helping me verbally process, grow, raise hard and contentious questions and receive so many more resources and feedback I am still processing I feel like I did 5 MOOCs and a degrrr in Kernel it was far more than I expected than a YC, graduate degree, or self-help coaching session. This has been powerful for me as a community organizer, entrepreneur, software engineer, computational designer, as a woman of color, colonized person, and avid reader. I so appreciate all the hard work it takes to create content, organize logistics, moderate, facilitate, and maintain as a steward and also much love to every single person in the Kernel community who has been responsive with every chat, every request, and every ask I have made whether verbal, written or otherwise. I am constantly amazed by this community and am so privileged to be a part of it. It's been an honor to be selected as a fellow and I can only hope I live up to what I set out to do next now with a framework that helps heal me and keep me grounded away from a hamster wheel that is life. I am taking a major cooling period after December and hope to share more work come 2022 with Kernel (maybe a future showcase), of all that's been incubating and cooking up in my head, behind Code editors and things I haven't pushed to GitHub, announced or made live yet. Lastly, thank you @Kevin Owocki for founding GitCoin, seeing you speak at Dystopia Labs and other conferences over the years always impressed me and I'm floored to have participated somehow in some small way related remotely to the work that you do, it is so important for the liberation of all people in the world and I hope that it continues to evolve with each Kernel block in the future.","by":"Erin Pangilinan"},{"message":"I am simply grateful for the wonderful fellows I have met from all around the world!

This actually was not necessarily an obvious link, because Source Cred has been coming at their solution from \"reputation,\" and we have been talking about \"matching.\" (See here for a history of this idea: <https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lYxOK30=/>). If you watch this <https://youtu.be/Ee99RK5_Jtg|condensed video (6 min)> of last night's discussion, you can see an example of what we call \"discoverability,\" which is huge problem within Kernel. This is because it is a highly innovative space, with high diversity of people from different backgrounds. That means that people might be working on different projects which might actually align in some way, but that is difficult to see on the surface (in other words, they would not be able to find each other using Google because of non-obvious search terms and lack of common language between different fields, or by simply listing what their project is about).  It takes a deeper dive into figuring out the \"why\" of what people are trying to do with their projects. So, thanks, Kris, for taking that time and making a really great connection which saved me so much work. You are a lifesaver.\n\nIn last night's session, we talked about Appreciation Bytes, our super-simple tool for noticing the often-invisible contributions of others which add to group intelligence. Our hypothesis is that we could use this to facilitate matching between a mess of groups, people, and projects, especially in a community-wide funding effort. It turns out that we have been working on the front end to what Source Cred has been developing the back end, and there is probably a high incidence of that in Kernel. Developing the machine and human technology to be able to put the memetic puzzles pieces together is a fascinating mission and one we look forward to helping to solve during our time at Kernel. @Sachin Mittal @Vivek Singh @Charles Blass","by":"Lauren Nignon"},{"message":"This is an amazing suggestion @Kris Is @Lauren Nignon.\n\nWould love to know thoughts from Sourcecred wizard @Angela Gilhotra\n\nP.S. — KERNEL Sourcred Slack plugin is coming soon :wink:","by":"Sachin Mittal"},{"message":"@Dandelion -- @Kris Is mentioned you're looking to test.... <http://cicolab.org|cicolab.org> definitely interested, ready :slightly_smiling_face:\nthx @Vivek Singh!  + @Angela Gilhotra, ears open","by":"Charles Blass"},{"message":"@Kris Is The 2/ quote confuses me.

In KB4, I've bonded, spent time with or been in the presence with these amazingly inspirational womxn of color @Vienna Looi @Songyi Lee @Holly Grimm @Jasmine Wang @Michelle Ma @Denise Schaefer @Rebecca Mqamelo @Juanna Zhai. I've been so moved by the work of @Richard Blythman @Matthew Scott Jones that I hope for the future of the “metaverse” and AI, places where I have felt trapped in centralized recreating inequalities for so long, that it's such a fresh breathe of air to see these amazing founders for their work and I can't wait to see more from them and work with them somehow in some fashion at the intersection as its relevant with my work in the future. I have an extremely long list of all the folks who demo’ed today at Showcase and Expo that I either plan on somehow integrating into in my future work (be a user, beta tester, adviser on their platform). Thank you (Salamat) again to @Alex Yao Lisa Lee Lucas (co-founder of NOVA with @Nicolas Nicolas Ponette) and Michelle Tsing (laptopradio and blockchain adviser to some companies out of Kernel and Blockchain at Berkeley accelerator) for pushing me to apply. I almost didn't and I am so glad I did. It is really encouraging me to do all the things I want to with DAOs, to not compromise my values, and stay true to myself, in a world obsessed with performative isms that is the Hollywood/Silicon Valley/DC/NY power and wealth hungry addicted and controlling egos that I try so hard to resist. Today I quit 3 social media networks, dropped 3 projects that no longer made sense, and am deciding to double down on what I believe is authentic to my nature and being, that will continue to serve me well personally and professionally in my work. Thank you so much for helping me verbally process, grow, raise hard and contentious questions and receive so many more resources and feedback I am still processing I feel like I did 5 MOOCs and a degrrr in Kernel it was far more than I expected than a YC, graduate degree, or self-help coaching session. This has been powerful for me as a community organizer, entrepreneur, software engineer, computational designer, as a woman of color, colonized person, and avid reader. I so appreciate all the hard work it takes to create content, organize logistics, moderate, facilitate, and maintain as a steward and also much love to every single person in the Kernel community who has been responsive with every chat, every request, and every ask I have made whether verbal, written or otherwise. I am constantly amazed by this community and am so privileged to be a part of it. It's been an honor to be selected as a fellow and I can only hope I live up to what I set out to do next now with a framework that helps heal me and keep me grounded away from a hamster wheel that is life. I am taking a major cooling period after December and hope to share more work come 2022 with Kernel (maybe a future showcase), of all that's been incubating and cooking up in my head, behind Code editors and things I haven't pushed to GitHub, announced or made live yet. Lastly, thank you @Kevin Owocki for founding GitCoin, seeing you speak at Dystopia Labs and other conferences over the years always impressed me and I'm floored to have participated somehow in some small way related remotely to the work that you do, it is so important for the liberation of all people in the world and I hope that it continues to evolve with each Kernel block in the future.","by":"Erin Pangilinan"},{"message":"Thank you <!subteam^S01JV5JPV6E|@kernel-stewards> and all the people I met along the way for this amazing journey.\n\n:sunny: I started KERNEL very hopeful, thinking I had found likeminded people, a community to learn, to build, and to be myself and not have to explain context before saying something.\n\n:partly_sunny_rain: Then I realized how wrong I was!

I guess); I'd get a little jealous seeing all the people saying thank you on this channel, feeling \"should I be doing more to get as enthusiastic and happy as them?\"; and just generally anxious for not having enough time to be with my family, do my full-time job (not for long), work on the next adventure, and also read and watch all the curated material.\n\nI'm not gonna lie, I still have those negative (complementary opposing) feelings... at least sometimes :slightly_smiling_face:.\n\n:mostly_sunny:But then I realized people and groups don't (necessarily) care about my expectations. I really understood and appreciated the \"group with loosely shared interests\" description of the fellows. I started to find new language to express my ideas, to communicate better, and to just appreciate those conflicting feelings, because they moved me to action. I found myself having more conversations and asking better questions (initially just to myself). And finally, thanks to a conversation with @Sarah Hamburg, who wisely said \"KERNEL is a marathon, not a sprint\" (Thanks for that, Sarah!), I started to think more long-term.\n\n:kernel-love: Thank you for igniting this in me. From this inner turmoil, love-hate relationship, that KERNEL has been, a new (hopefully better) Guillermo emerges.\nI look forward to more adventures together and continue to obsessively check this slack in the future (I struggle to control my FOMO). Thanks @Sarah Hamburg @Holly Grimm @Saskia Westhof @Aimara Garcia Cabezas @Greg Becker @Ray Di Felice @snax y-not @Tim Courtney for amazing conversations.\n\nFinally, the whole theme of KERNEL reminded me of <https://sites.evergreen.edu/politicalshakespeares/wp-content/uploads/sites/226/2015/12/Borges-Tl%C3%B6n-Uqbar-Orbius-Tertius.pdf|\"Tlon, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius\">, by my favorite author Jorge Luis Borges.

This actually was not necessarily an obvious link, because Source Cred has been coming at their solution from \"reputation,\" and we have been talking about \"matching.\" (See here for a history of this idea: <https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lYxOK30=/>). If you watch this <https://youtu.be/Ee99RK5_Jtg|condensed video (6 min)> of last night's discussion, you can see an example of what we call \"discoverability,\" which is huge problem within Kernel. This is because it is a highly innovative space, with high diversity of people from different backgrounds. That means that people might be working on different projects which might actually align in some way, but that is difficult to see on the surface (in other words, they would not be able to find each other using Google because of non-obvious search terms and lack of common language between different fields, or by simply listing what their project is about).  It takes a deeper dive into figuring out the \"why\" of what people are trying to do with their projects. So, thanks, Kris, for taking that time and making a really great connection which saved me so much work. You are a lifesaver.\n\nIn last night's session, we talked about Appreciation Bytes, our super-simple tool for noticing the often-invisible contributions of others which add to group intelligence. Our hypothesis is that we could use this to facilitate matching between a mess of groups, people, and projects, especially in a community-wide funding effort. It turns out that we have been working on the front end to what Source Cred has been developing the back end, and there is probably a high incidence of that in Kernel. Developing the machine and human technology to be able to put the memetic puzzles pieces together is a fascinating mission and one we look forward to helping to solve during our time at Kernel. @Sachin Mittal @Vivek Singh @Charles Blass","by":"Lauren Nignon"}],"count":1},"attributes":[{"trait_type":"award","value":"Collective Intelligentsia "},{"trait_type":"testimonial","value":"Charles -- thank you for helping us meld CICOLAB and KERNEL into a wonderful space in Block 2.

Thanks for letting me cry in Twitter Spaces today @Vivek Singh @alisha @Angela Gilhotra @cryptowanderer @Sachin Mittal. In KB4, I've bonded, spent time with or been in the presence with these amazingly inspirational womxn of color @Vienna Looi @Songyi Lee @Holly Grimm @Jasmine Wang @Michelle Ma @Denise Schaefer @Rebecca Mqamelo @Juanna Zhai. I've been so moved by the work of @Richard Blythman @Matthew Scott Jones that I hope for the future of the “metaverse” and AI, places where I have felt trapped in centralized recreating inequalities for so long, that it's such a fresh breathe of air to see these amazing founders for their work and I can't wait to see more from them and work with them somehow in some fashion at the intersection as its relevant with my work in the future. I have an extremely long list of all the folks who demo’ed today at Showcase and Expo that I either plan on somehow integrating into in my future work (be a user, beta tester, adviser on their platform). Thank you (Salamat) again to @Alex Yao Lisa Lee Lucas (co-founder of NOVA with @Nicolas Nicolas Ponette) and Michelle Tsing (laptopradio and blockchain adviser to some companies out of Kernel and Blockchain at Berkeley accelerator) for pushing me to apply. I almost didn't and I am so glad I did. It is really encouraging me to do all the things I want to with DAOs, to not compromise my values, and stay true to myself, in a world obsessed with performative isms that is the Hollywood/Silicon Valley/DC/NY power and wealth hungry addicted and controlling egos that I try so hard to resist. Today I quit 3 social media networks, dropped 3 projects that no longer made sense, and am deciding to double down on what I believe is authentic to my nature and being, that will continue to serve me well personally and professionally in my work. Thank you so much for helping me verbally process, grow, raise hard and contentious questions and receive so many more resources and feedback I am still processing I feel like I did 5 MOOCs and a degrrr in Kernel it was far more than I expected than a YC, graduate degree, or self-help coaching session. This has been powerful for me as a community organizer, entrepreneur, software engineer, computational designer, as a woman of color, colonized person, and avid reader. I so appreciate all the hard work it takes to create content, organize logistics, moderate, facilitate, and maintain as a steward and also much love to every single person in the Kernel community who has been responsive with every chat, every request, and every ask I have made whether verbal, written or otherwise. I am constantly amazed by this community and am so privileged to be a part of it. It's been an honor to be selected as a fellow and I can only hope I live up to what I set out to do next now with a framework that helps heal me and keep me grounded away from a hamster wheel that is life. I am taking a major cooling period after December and hope to share more work come 2022 with Kernel (maybe a future showcase), of all that's been incubating and cooking up in my head, behind Code editors and things I haven't pushed to GitHub, announced or made live yet. Lastly, thank you @Kevin Owocki for founding GitCoin, seeing you speak at Dystopia Labs and other conferences over the years always impressed me and I'm floored to have participated somehow in some small way related remotely to the work that you do, it is so important for the liberation of all people in the world and I hope that it continues to evolve with each Kernel block in the future.","by":"Erin Pangilinan"},{"message":"A gift of deep gratitude for friends old and new, for all that has been shared to honour our time together :pray:\n\n<https://kernel.community/en/conversation/true-voice/>\n\ncc @Harold Davis @Sparrow Read @Sebnem @Abe Uccello @Holly Grimm @Matthew Stephenson @Muhammad Hameed @Tagan Horton @alisha @Ellena Rapaport @Anna Alexa @Rebecca Mqamelo and the many others who will hopefully continue to grow this conversation over many, many years :heart:","by":"cryptowanderer"},{"message":"\n“Know that thankfulness is from the highest of stations, and it is higher than patience and fear and detachment of this world.”  - Imam Al-Ghazali\n\nCultivating gratitude is the most beautiful art we can create.

You folks are amazing and your help instrumental.\n\nOther fellows, always positive, helpful and inspiring in the best way possible even while busy with their own adventures, like @Simon Fremaux, @Carl Farterson and the best-practices gang, @Holly Grimm, and the DADA team, even if we didn't interact much directly, know you've been an inspiration for many years!\n\nAnd how can we not be grateful for the Kernel team, receiving us all with open arms and unparalleled patience and kindness, @Sachin Mittal, @Vivek Singh and others, one-of-a-kind human beings which I'm honoured to have met and spend time with. :pray:\n\nLastly, I can't write this without a special note to @cryptowanderer, embracing the project mission from the start, contributing in ways I couldn't have expected, making what the project is today a reality, you're amazing, thank you again.\n\nOne can say riding a market like we're experiencing today as a solo builder with a somewhat market-fit product can feel like choosing Jaws, Maui as a go-to surf spot while still learning to surf, sure some can pull off the once-in-a-lifetime herculean task of achieving so alone...But what enables surfers to, time and time again, execute this impressive feat, a humbling celebration of our ability to face head-first the scariest challenges posed by nature, are exactly other humans, community, supporters often not celebrated, from the tow-in jet sky riders, the lifeguards bringing you oxygen, to the chanting crowd by the coast and even the sharks keeping you alert.\n\nBack to the point, what is being done here at Kernel is unique, every step planned with a level of care hard to find elsewhere, and it is also upon us all to keep this flame awake and the kernel culture principled, I hope to in the future be able to help others the same way I was helped here, for that is what makes the world go round.\n\nFor now, thank you Kernel, for all, and happy spring! :seedling:","by":"Adrian le Bas"}],"count":2},"attributes":[{"trait_type":"award","value":""},{"trait_type":"testimonial","value":"Dave.

His great articulation of the benefits of consensus &amp; the creation of new bottom up structures-- seems to speak to where the weight of transformative power of indigenous dialogue resides. Not having to start from scratch in autonomous creation of new sustainable structures is a huge advantage we shouldn’t take for granted on any front.\n\nInsights to western misnomers of indigenous social structures through a matrilineal indigenous &amp; _Kanienke'ha'ka perspective (misnomer - Mohawk)_: \n\nFemale/Male Chief = “The Best of us”-- chosen by women title-holders with 100% consensus decision making. “(De)horned” by women when deemed ineligible for title. No campaigns or elections, to avoid any “perception of corruption.” Perceptions of possible pillow talk amongst representatives means title-holders can not be married to each other for example.\n\nHereditary - Is reference to clan —not blood, or immediate family. Used as mechanism to protect against nepotism or any “perceptions of corruption,” not to ensure nepotism as in the western context. Even if not blood &amp; across the territory for example— inter clan marriage is illegal. Representatives can not hand down title to their children-- as in the western meaning of hereditary monarchies. Clan is blood only in the case that legally clan can only be given by mother to children. If your mother is does not have a clan but your father does you are his  “__” clan “hung about the neck.” This becomes relevant in case of legal title eligibility. \n\nElected Tribal or Band councils across the hemisphere today do not abide by any of these native constitution laws —their chief title only being legal in context of municipalities of respective colonial nations — which means they have signed away their rightful nation to nation status of the Two Row Wampum Peace Treaty. We can never express our gratitude to the women of the Longhouse in Kahnawake, who have kept this Peace Treaty alive for us to leverage today. \n\nSlavery - The Longhouse is adamant about the absence of slavery in the hemisphere. The Longhouse is also always careful not to speak on the protocols of other native nations. So this strong stance on slavery is likely a reference to the continuity that also exist amongst those distinctions—from a common history &amp; cosmology “the journey of the corn.”\n\nThis is consistent with the Longhouse’s oral documentation of “the bringing into the heart fire” concept of indigenous ”justice systems.” Hereditary in the indigenous context becomes important in Wengrow’s mention of “hereditary slavery”--because it likely points to an adoption into clan mechanism, merely getting lost in an ethnographic translation. To jail or imprison a human being in Longhouse oral documentation has always been illegal. So it follows that anything even closely resembling the chattel style slavery we attach to the word would inherently be deemed illegal as well. The worst of crimes meant being marked on the face as the worst of offenders, to be easily identified by surrounding nations -- then let free in to the wilderness. Or killed immediately for the heinous offense. \n\nHinting at possible matrilineal continuity across oceans — this is also consistent with other matrilineal justice mechanisms of Africa. Mentioned by polymath, physicist, anthropologist, archaeologist, linguist, historian —Cheikh Anta Diop. Diop describes precolonial west African nations having intricate protocols for bringing local/regional rule benders into the family for a determined period of time —after which it was then illegal to ever disparage the person by even mentioning the crime or this time of the person’s life. \n\nThis last nuance actually points to elaborate cultural protections against free labor —as does clan adoption via “bringing into the heart fire” in the native context. \n\nChattel slavery is largely dependent on quite the contrary elaborate cultural mechanisms of dehumanization — rhetoric of infidels was just as pop culture as minstrel shows, toys, cartoons food labels &amp; children restaurants called “Little Black Sambo” as recent as the 80s here in the states for example. These indigenous systems seem to be humanizing as much as possible with protections against dehumanization.\n\nThis makes lot more sense than this “heart fire” phrasing being a sick euphemism for what is the Islamic origin of chattel slavery ,in which we are the most familiar in the west. As Graeber mentions the folks in the 1500s having a hard time believing natives had even heard of Jesus let alone (or practice human sacrifice to demons) denounce him. This may be a continuation of this same phenomenon via the slavery misnomer that is rooted in old world religious, political &amp; economic systems. Far removed from a precolonial native world. \n\n“The forgotten slave trade” of east Africa &amp; what was then — extensions of these east African nations into the Middle East. Resulted in an ethnic cleansing not unlike what has happened in modern Palestine in our lifetime. It also lasted long enough to overlap with the west African slave trade. \nNot unlike our real time awareness of geopolitics today, important history of both eras of African slavery are largely lost to highly politicized &amp; or religious narratives, somehow skipping over indigenous spiritual/cultural influence in the regions for millenia. Diop mentions interesting west African context often left out — the “bringing into the heart fire” style justice systems were still intact in these still precolonial black African nations — this was exploited by slave traders before raids became necessary because these nations rose to the defense of their people after discovering the crime. \n\nNone of this takes away from Graeber’s overall point of empirical political data over millenia giving robust design to political systems of the hemisphere. The details here merely add to the importance of Graeber’s work &amp; due diligence in this area of study — work virtually unprecedented in his peers past or present. These details are also likely derivatives of the formulaic aspect of indigenous modes of social organization — explaining the cultural continuity in respective hemispheres. All distinct cultures of course but also self similar like the coast lines themselves, through common cosmological significations expressing beautiful social resilience in diversity. \n\nGraeber is also spot on in another remarkable and extremely relevant way for those of us here in this cohort together. Wage slavery is another kind of slavery we are familiar with — and this is where there is some actual real independent cultural overlap! The pre-colonial Five Nations Longhouse Confederacy was on the brink of falling into perpetual cycles of wage based slavery similar but likely also distinct from modern industrialized systems. \n\nThis is oral documentation of nations coming out of war and into peace 2.5k yrs ago. Wampum shells for the beads on strings of sinew that was used for trade; were becoming commodified. Not from old world systems of settler colonial extraction &amp; military market creation of course; the shells were becoming commodified by default of nations at war. War meant it simply wasn’t safe to collect these shells from the lakes. War eventually created a corrupted mind that was content to have others work for them via control of these shells. This mind was successfully transformed with matrilineal council that protected long term, against male dominant commodification of all strains of life — this lasted up until colonization. \n\nThe League of Peace formed 2.5k yrs ago out of this empirical data matched with even older formulaic design that goes back to Sky Woman herself. This is a beautiful precedent that is desperately needed in these times. And Graeber’s words truly become prophetic in this context. @cryptowanderer @Vivek Singh @Magenta Ceiba @Sparrow Read","by":"Harold Davis"},{"message":"Ok, phew :sweat_smile:\n\n@Harold Davis I have colonised your notes :wink: <https://kernel.community/conversation/>\n\nPlease forgive me?

In the oral documentation, war is what leads to the commodification of the wampum shells, not the other way around. This suggests that protections for matrilineal heritage in all strains of life embedded into collective decision making processes for peaceful diplomacy between nations is imperative for longterm sustainability in complex systems.\n\nWithout this protection, everything is at risk of commodification --war seems to create an artificial scarcity that bleeds into every aspect of our social &amp; eco organization. Artificial scarcity replaces the reality of regenerative abundance --hence the harm of a global male dominant system. The commodification starts with our means for tracking morphology of long term dynamics --wampum shells. Indigenous modes of tracking transactions were less about value placement than ensuring balance was being maintained in complex dynamics. \"Balance always has to come from where there is more\"-- making value placements on goods less relevant than the mechanism of keeping record.\n\nAfter our tracking mechanisms are compromised, your presumption of untamed brutal extraction/commodification to follow seems spot on. What is ultimately a tool for tracking the collective health of our mother's body (Earth) becomes a tool for her brutalization. A fundamental belief of regenerative abundance is replaced with a fundamental belief of scarcity. Our entire regenerative heritage is then made invisible &amp; then easily exploited, from smallest levels to the largest levels of Sky Woman's spiral design.

My one thought is about the danger of exclusive focus. That is, while I agree that the ground itself is always experiential, I do think that it must be balanced by some kind of rigor. How to come to this without falling into the trap of a will to power or attempt to control/make legible is my question. If we say it's _only_ about experience, then there are no reasonable grounds on which to engage meaningfully and we end up in the so-called New Age.\n\n@Sebnem wonderful to have you back :pray: thank you for this insightful pattern re-cognition: it is deeply helpful for me.\n\n&gt; I'm still unable to formulate what this is about, what is it that \"practically\" we're talking about.\nYour scare quotes indicate the understanding that what we're talking about is not practical in the general meaning of that word (for this reason, by the rule of complementary opposites, it is the only truly practical knowledge we can cultivate). What we're talking about is, in a profound way, far less important than the fact we are talking. That's meta Level 1. First, we develop awareness of awareness. Then, we recognise that the fact we're talking is most critical, but what we are saying is also genuinely important - not in terms of our own opinion, but in terms of seeing ourselves more clearly (i.e. my realisation about synthesis and power was a major moment for me - meta Level 2). Awareness of awareness of awareness. It is this doubly-aware mind which sees that the drive to connect with the other is a part of seeing our own self more clearly: for the more intimate and immediate the connection, the clearer the mirror.\n\nSelf-recursively honing awareness through dialogue, through lived contemplation in honest reflection with others, is a large part of how I experience interactions like this. Awareness bent back on itself with skill eventually \"disappears\". There is the open field beyond right or wrong. There is 'satori': a sudden and ecstatic insight into the ground of your own being. There is the silence which comes home to stay in a heart that has been emptied of all its images, leaving only the unconditional love which is its nature; its origin and destiny.

His great articulation of the benefits of consensus &amp; the creation of new bottom up structures-- seems to speak to where the weight of transformative power of indigenous dialogue resides. Not having to start from scratch in autonomous creation of new sustainable structures is a huge advantage we shouldn’t take for granted on any front.\n\nInsights to western misnomers of indigenous social structures through a matrilineal indigenous &amp; _Kanienke'ha'ka perspective (misnomer - Mohawk)_: \n\nFemale/Male Chief = “The Best of us”-- chosen by women title-holders with 100% consensus decision making. “(De)horned” by women when deemed ineligible for title. No campaigns or elections, to avoid any “perception of corruption.” Perceptions of possible pillow talk amongst representatives means title-holders can not be married to each other for example.\n\nHereditary - Is reference to clan —not blood, or immediate family. Used as mechanism to protect against nepotism or any “perceptions of corruption,” not to ensure nepotism as in the western context. Even if not blood &amp; across the territory for example— inter clan marriage is illegal. Representatives can not hand down title to their children-- as in the western meaning of hereditary monarchies. Clan is blood only in the case that legally clan can only be given by mother to children. If your mother is does not have a clan but your father does you are his  “__” clan “hung about the neck.” This becomes relevant in case of legal title eligibility. \n\nElected Tribal or Band councils across the hemisphere today do not abide by any of these native constitution laws —their chief title only being legal in context of municipalities of respective colonial nations — which means they have signed away their rightful nation to nation status of the Two Row Wampum Peace Treaty. We can never express our gratitude to the women of the Longhouse in Kahnawake, who have kept this Peace Treaty alive for us to leverage today. \n\nSlavery - The Longhouse is adamant about the absence of slavery in the hemisphere. The Longhouse is also always careful not to speak on the protocols of other native nations. So this strong stance on slavery is likely a reference to the continuity that also exist amongst those distinctions—from a common history &amp; cosmology “the journey of the corn.”\n\nThis is consistent with the Longhouse’s oral documentation of “the bringing into the heart fire” concept of indigenous ”justice systems.” Hereditary in the indigenous context becomes important in Wengrow’s mention of “hereditary slavery”--because it likely points to an adoption into clan mechanism, merely getting lost in an ethnographic translation. To jail or imprison a human being in Longhouse oral documentation has always been illegal. So it follows that anything even closely resembling the chattel style slavery we attach to the word would inherently be deemed illegal as well. The worst of crimes meant being marked on the face as the worst of offenders, to be easily identified by surrounding nations -- then let free in to the wilderness. Or killed immediately for the heinous offense. \n\nHinting at possible matrilineal continuity across oceans — this is also consistent with other matrilineal justice mechanisms of Africa. Mentioned by polymath, physicist, anthropologist, archaeologist, linguist, historian —Cheikh Anta Diop. Diop describes precolonial west African nations having intricate protocols for bringing local/regional rule benders into the family for a determined period of time —after which it was then illegal to ever disparage the person by even mentioning the crime or this time of the person’s life. \n\nThis last nuance actually points to elaborate cultural protections against free labor —as does clan adoption via “bringing into the heart fire” in the native context. \n\nChattel slavery is largely dependent on quite the contrary elaborate cultural mechanisms of dehumanization — rhetoric of infidels was just as pop culture as minstrel shows, toys, cartoons food labels &amp; children restaurants called “Little Black Sambo” as recent as the 80s here in the states for example. These indigenous systems seem to be humanizing as much as possible with protections against dehumanization.\n\nThis makes lot more sense than this “heart fire” phrasing being a sick euphemism for what is the Islamic origin of chattel slavery ,in which we are the most familiar in the west. As Graeber mentions the folks in the 1500s having a hard time believing natives had even heard of Jesus let alone (or practice human sacrifice to demons) denounce him. This may be a continuation of this same phenomenon via the slavery misnomer that is rooted in old world religious, political &amp; economic systems. Far removed from a precolonial native world. \n\n“The forgotten slave trade” of east Africa &amp; what was then — extensions of these east African nations into the Middle East. Resulted in an ethnic cleansing not unlike what has happened in modern Palestine in our lifetime. It also lasted long enough to overlap with the west African slave trade. \nNot unlike our real time awareness of geopolitics today, important history of both eras of African slavery are largely lost to highly politicized &amp; or religious narratives, somehow skipping over indigenous spiritual/cultural influence in the regions for millenia. Diop mentions interesting west African context often left out — the “bringing into the heart fire” style justice systems were still intact in these still precolonial black African nations — this was exploited by slave traders before raids became necessary because these nations rose to the defense of their people after discovering the crime. \n\nNone of this takes away from Graeber’s overall point of empirical political data over millenia giving robust design to political systems of the hemisphere. The details here merely add to the importance of Graeber’s work &amp; due diligence in this area of study — work virtually unprecedented in his peers past or present. These details are also likely derivatives of the formulaic aspect of indigenous modes of social organization — explaining the cultural continuity in respective hemispheres. All distinct cultures of course but also self similar like the coast lines themselves, through common cosmological significations expressing beautiful social resilience in diversity. \n\nGraeber is also spot on in another remarkable and extremely relevant way for those of us here in this cohort together. Wage slavery is another kind of slavery we are familiar with — and this is where there is some actual real independent cultural overlap! The pre-colonial Five Nations Longhouse Confederacy was on the brink of falling into perpetual cycles of wage based slavery similar but likely also distinct from modern industrialized systems. \n\nThis is oral documentation of nations coming out of war and into peace 2.5k yrs ago. Wampum shells for the beads on strings of sinew that was used for trade; were becoming commodified. Not from old world systems of settler colonial extraction &amp; military market creation of course; the shells were becoming commodified by default of nations at war. War meant it simply wasn’t safe to collect these shells from the lakes. War eventually created a corrupted mind that was content to have others work for them via control of these shells. This mind was successfully transformed with matrilineal council that protected long term, against male dominant commodification of all strains of life — this lasted up until colonization. \n\nThe League of Peace formed 2.5k yrs ago out of this empirical data matched with even older formulaic design that goes back to Sky Woman herself. This is a beautiful precedent that is desperately needed in these times. And Graeber’s words truly become prophetic in this context. @cryptowanderer @Vivek Singh @Magenta Ceiba @Sparrow Read","by":"Harold Davis"},{"message":"@cryptowanderer I'm always up for moving things around for this kind of dialogue mane haha What say you @Sparrow Read @Magenta Ceiba @Holly Grimm@Vivek Singh@Sebnem@Bea DADA??","by":"Harold Davis"},{"message":"<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjBLGXhKMp8|cheesy song> alert, just for you @Magenta Ceiba :rotating_light:","by":"cryptowanderer"},{"message":"Ok beautiful, ty kindly @cryptowanderer for initiating this!

Thanks for letting me cry in Twitter Spaces today @Vivek Singh @alisha @Angela Gilhotra @cryptowanderer @Sachin Mittal. In KB4, I've bonded, spent time with or been in the presence with these amazingly inspirational womxn of color @Vienna Looi @Songyi Lee @Holly Grimm @Jasmine Wang @Michelle Ma @Denise Schaefer @Rebecca Mqamelo @Juanna Zhai. I've been so moved by the work of @Richard Blythman @Matthew Scott Jones that I hope for the future of the “metaverse” and AI, places where I have felt trapped in centralized recreating inequalities for so long, that it's such a fresh breathe of air to see these amazing founders for their work and I can't wait to see more from them and work with them somehow in some fashion at the intersection as its relevant with my work in the future. I have an extremely long list of all the folks who demo’ed today at Showcase and Expo that I either plan on somehow integrating into in my future work (be a user, beta tester, adviser on their platform). Thank you (Salamat) again to @Alex Yao Lisa Lee Lucas (co-founder of NOVA with @Nicolas Nicolas Ponette) and Michelle Tsing (laptopradio and blockchain adviser to some companies out of Kernel and Blockchain at Berkeley accelerator) for pushing me to apply. I almost didn't and I am so glad I did. It is really encouraging me to do all the things I want to with DAOs, to not compromise my values, and stay true to myself, in a world obsessed with performative isms that is the Hollywood/Silicon Valley/DC/NY power and wealth hungry addicted and controlling egos that I try so hard to resist. Today I quit 3 social media networks, dropped 3 projects that no longer made sense, and am deciding to double down on what I believe is authentic to my nature and being, that will continue to serve me well personally and professionally in my work. Thank you so much for helping me verbally process, grow, raise hard and contentious questions and receive so many more resources and feedback I am still processing I feel like I did 5 MOOCs and a degrrr in Kernel it was far more than I expected than a YC, graduate degree, or self-help coaching session. This has been powerful for me as a community organizer, entrepreneur, software engineer, computational designer, as a woman of color, colonized person, and avid reader. I so appreciate all the hard work it takes to create content, organize logistics, moderate, facilitate, and maintain as a steward and also much love to every single person in the Kernel community who has been responsive with every chat, every request, and every ask I have made whether verbal, written or otherwise. I am constantly amazed by this community and am so privileged to be a part of it. It's been an honor to be selected as a fellow and I can only hope I live up to what I set out to do next now with a framework that helps heal me and keep me grounded away from a hamster wheel that is life. I am taking a major cooling period after December and hope to share more work come 2022 with Kernel (maybe a future showcase), of all that's been incubating and cooking up in my head, behind Code editors and things I haven't pushed to GitHub, announced or made live yet. Lastly, thank you @Kevin Owocki for founding GitCoin, seeing you speak at Dystopia Labs and other conferences over the years always impressed me and I'm floored to have participated somehow in some small way related remotely to the work that you do, it is so important for the liberation of all people in the world and I hope that it continues to evolve with each Kernel block in the future.","by":"Erin Pangilinan"}],"count":1},"attributes":[{"trait_type":"award","value":""},{"trait_type":"testimonial","value":""},{"display_type":"number","trait_type":"Gratitude Count","value":1}]},"26052095953184200":{"tokenId":26052095953184200,"image":"https://api.kernel.community/26052095953184200.png","external_url":"https://gratitude.kernel.community/c/5c8e3e44f1a5c762115a768d9fab4627e3e5f5fadd528bacb9aaa1d93b1eede9","name":"Kimi Wu","award":"","testimonial":"","gratitude":{},"attributes":[{"trait_type":"award","value":""},{"trait_type":"testimonial","value":""},{"display_type":"number","trait_type":"Gratitude Count","value":0}]},"23886534805087560":{"tokenId":23886534805087560,"image":"https://api.kernel.community/23886534805087560.png","external_url":"https://gratitude.kernel.community/c/54dcad45f8e547b9ec1c55c1e0dd7d5931836ff3e7807c970bcc38b116e51671","name":"Tony Snark","award":"","testimonial":"To our beloved anon friend, we'll always be rooting for you -- whether in on-chain acquisitions or off-chain explorations in Italy, grateful to know you and excited for what you do next.","gratitude":{},"attributes":[{"trait_type":"award","value":""},{"trait_type":"testimonial","value":"To our beloved anon friend, we'll always be rooting for you -- whether in on-chain acquisitions or off-chain explorations in Italy, grateful to know you and excited for what you do next."},{"display_type":"number","trait_type":"Gratitude Count","value":0}]},"10180354268963528":{"tokenId":10180354268963528,"image":"https://api.kernel.community/10180354268963528.png","external_url":"https://gratitude.kernel.community/c/242afa6fe3a2c9598839e8216cb310da0b65074e738c495ab52731a7573aaa40","name":"Kevin Keaveney","award":"","testimonial":"","gratitude":{},"attributes":[{"trait_type":"award","value":""},{"trait_type":"testimonial","value":""},{"display_type":"number","trait_type":"Gratitude Count","value":0}]},"65661136664602230":{"tokenId":65661136664602230,"image":"https://api.kernel.community/65661136664602230.png","external_url":"https://gratitude.kernel.community/c/e94674b6712676af55e5c483c31fc4f88ad908c478811517a70678d1a31d136f","name":"Pham Khanh","award":"","testimonial":"","gratitude":{},"attributes":[{"trait_type":"award","value":""},{"trait_type":"testimonial","value":""},{"display_type":"number","trait_type":"Gratitude Count","value":0}]},"30360146779339650":{"tokenId":30360146779339650,"image":"https://api.kernel.community/30360146779339650.png","external_url":"https://gratitude.kernel.community/c/6bdc64841c7b80383c81bfff3fa044fea9c51c6c0ff063e49c24c415e1bff724","name":"Ludovic Levalleux","award":"","testimonial":"","gratitude":{},"attributes":[{"trait_type":"award","value":""},{"trait_type":"testimonial","value":""},{"display_type":"number","trait_type":"Gratitude Count","value":0}]},"42357202981705850":{"tokenId":42357202981705850,"image":"https://api.kernel.community/42357202981705850.png","external_url":"https://gratitude.kernel.community/c/967ba6d567587a331b6612df124c02682123482e5cbd3dff252ea193dfdf15ae","name":"Stina Gustafsson","award":"","testimonial":"","gratitude":{},"attributes":[{"trait_type":"award","value":""},{"trait_type":"testimonial","value":""},{"display_type":"number","trait_type":"Gratitude Count","value":0}]},"7095600735484890":{"tokenId":7095600735484890,"image":"https://api.kernel.community/7095600735484890.png","external_url":"https://gratitude.kernel.community/c/193569494e7bda62eb9e12b0fac79fef4b231308466ffbc358655183349fb95b","name":"Jibran","award":"","testimonial":"","gratitude":{},"attributes":[{"trait_type":"award","value":""},{"trait_type":"testimonial","value":""},{"display_type":"number","trait_type":"Gratitude Count","value":0}]},"69344997217528160":{"tokenId":69344997217528160,"image":"https://api.kernel.community/69344997217528160.png","external_url":"https://gratitude.kernel.community/c/f65ce85619e95fbbf2353b5294906cda2d298aba4dc014aa541bff123e71b200","name":"Alexander Yoseph","award":"","testimonial":"Alex -- brother.

You folks are amazing and your help instrumental.\n\nOther fellows, always positive, helpful and inspiring in the best way possible even while busy with their own adventures, like @Simon Fremaux, @Carl Farterson and the best-practices gang, @Holly Grimm, and the DADA team, even if we didn't interact much directly, know you've been an inspiration for many years!\n\nAnd how can we not be grateful for the Kernel team, receiving us all with open arms and unparalleled patience and kindness, @Sachin Mittal, @Vivek Singh and others, one-of-a-kind human beings which I'm honoured to have met and spend time with. :pray:\n\nLastly, I can't write this without a special note to @cryptowanderer, embracing the project mission from the start, contributing in ways I couldn't have expected, making what the project is today a reality, you're amazing, thank you again.\n\nOne can say riding a market like we're experiencing today as a solo builder with a somewhat market-fit product can feel like choosing Jaws, Maui as a go-to surf spot while still learning to surf, sure some can pull off the once-in-a-lifetime herculean task of achieving so alone...But what enables surfers to, time and time again, execute this impressive feat, a humbling celebration of our ability to face head-first the scariest challenges posed by nature, are exactly other humans, community, supporters often not celebrated, from the tow-in jet sky riders, the lifeguards bringing you oxygen, to the chanting crowd by the coast and even the sharks keeping you alert.\n\nBack to the point, what is being done here at Kernel is unique, every step planned with a level of care hard to find elsewhere, and it is also upon us all to keep this flame awake and the kernel culture principled, I hope to in the future be able to help others the same way I was helped here, for that is what makes the world go round.\n\nFor now, thank you Kernel, for all, and happy spring! :seedling:","by":"Adrian le Bas"}],"count":1},"attributes":[{"trait_type":"award","value":""},{"trait_type":"testimonial","value":""},{"display_type":"number","trait_type":"Gratitude Count","value":1}]},"36416889972826056":{"tokenId":36416889972826056,"image":"https://api.kernel.community/36416889972826056.png","external_url":"https://gratitude.kernel.community/c/8160f7eea79fc577a56e6d9d4827cf85a3d2f0dcf98b77bf399c9da49dc48535","name":"LeRae Bigelow","award":"","testimonial":"","gratitude":{},"attributes":[{"trait_type":"award","value":""},{"trait_type":"testimonial","value":""},{"display_type":"number","trait_type":"Gratitude Count","value":0}]},"6738684729214724":{"tokenId":6738684729214724,"image":"https://api.kernel.community/6738684729214724.png","external_url":"https://gratitude.kernel.community/c/17f0cc4d89c704a159521ff74f8a8701d59c770f76b649742b29cc9711687249","name":"Zak Cole","award":"","testimonial":"","gratitude":{},"attributes":[{"trait_type":"award","value":""},{"trait_type":"testimonial","value":""},{"display_type":"number","trait_type":"Gratitude Count","value":0}]},"2790565549166717":{"tokenId":2790565549166717,"image":"https://api.kernel.community/2790565549166717.png","external_url":"https://gratitude.kernel.community/c/09ea012c47d07d37a6bd472571041796fa0ef5ba0a18680dce87f2b2ad39fca9","name":"Mehdi Zerouali","award":"","testimonial":"","gratitude":{},"attributes":[{"trait_type":"award","value":""},{"trait_type":"testimonial","value":""},{"display_type":"number","trait_type":"Gratitude Count","value":0}]},"71793786346744840":{"tokenId":71793786346744840,"image":"https://api.kernel.community/71793786346744840.png","external_url":"https://gratitude.kernel.community/c/ff10117c472c0a4a8c238b232734471472909f9bf2401cca4445368465c514b8","name":"Dani Osorio","award":"","testimonial":"","gratitude":{},"attributes":[{"trait_type":"award","value":""},{"trait_type":"testimonial","value":""},{"display_type":"number","trait_type":"Gratitude Count","value":0}]},"57902343138991784":{"tokenId":57902343138991784,"image":"https://api.kernel.community/57902343138991784.png","external_url":"https://gratitude.kernel.community/c/cdb5dfd2765eab4ea637d03fb122be1565bd03b8587b1df74ad8ec032aae098b","name":"pet3rpan","award":"","testimonial":"","gratitude":{"received":[{"message":"So many people to thank here, I’d like to express gratitude towards people that keep this community alive. \n@Vivek Singh: for hosting weekly sessions, mentorship, connecting us with wonderful people in this space and for being a friend. \n@Sachin Mittal: for intros, office hours, resources and your support to our project. \n@Holly Grimm: for guiding us to build generative artwork, supporting Coinvise and working on an impactful project.\n@cryptowanderer: Your thoughts on building communities, blue book and ideas inspire me. \n@Harsh Rajat: for helping us setup Coinvise and supporting us all the way\n@Zayi Reyes, @christina, @Mekyle Naidoo @Alexander Yoseph, @pet3rpan and many more.

Not enough can be said to thank all the Stewards who paved this entire block @Vivek Singh @Angela Gilhotra @Sachin Mittal @cryptowanderer @johnx25bd and everyone else involved! This experience was a gift, and I am glad I was one of the few lucky ones to be able to receive it so far.\n\nThanks to all the mentors and guests who took time off their hectic days to talk to us Fellows, and guide us through our journey. The juntos, fireside, KERNEL Cafe, One-to-one Offerings, etc. was just beautiful. I am glad I was able to speak with many of you in <!subteam^S0224NELPGD|@kb3> and I hope we keep the ties strong. I love how everyone in this group is either building something or looking for inspiration to start. I love what everyone is working on, and I wish everyone the best in their journeys from here on.\n\nLots of gratitude and love to you all!\nSpecial shoutouts to @Paulo Almeida @Serg Lotz @Rahul // r-nk.xyz @Leo Lara @Rev Miller @En Canada @Tagan Horton @stickykeys @Sebastian T F @Aiswarya Walter @alisha and everyone else whom I've met in KERNEL, and had conversations with.\n\n\n\n:v::kernel-love::musical_note:  to all!","by":"Robin Roy Thomas"},{"message":"\n“Know that thankfulness is from the highest of stations, and it is higher than patience and fear and detachment of this world.”  - Imam Al-Ghazali\n\nCultivating gratitude is the most beautiful art we can create. The social, emotional dynamics and constant personal growth that is required for the deep collaboration that forges hyper effective teams is grossly understated. For that reason I am grateful to my friend, peer, co-founder and comrade in Web 3 @Tagan Horton. Without her spirit, energy, fortitude and self determination the KERNEL experience and Dakar Gallery would not be possible. \n\nKERNEL has been a lesson in play and a journey of gratitude. While it is impossible to pinpoint one person or Kernel experience I am grateful to @Vivek Singh for setting the tone for gratitude per our first conversation days before KERNEL started. Furthermore I’m forever grateful for the insight and wisdom shared by @cryptowanderer that both challenged me yet made me feel at home in my personal study; and for @Sachin Mittal, @johnx25bd and the inspiration and feedback from @Jeet Raut, @Nuno Neto, @Abe Uccello, @tina, @Paul Gadi, @Paulo Almeida @Rahul // r-nk.xyz @Rajesh Kadam @Reuben Bramanathan @Rebecca Mqamelo.

My web3 journey didn't start with Kernel but it did start with Gitcoin back in early 2019 after I heard a podcast with @Kevin Owocki that was my first step down the rabbit hole.  After hacking away on bounties for more than year (quite a few for Gitcoin Core), I saw the first mentions of the Kernel program and applied.  After a fruitful interview with @Vivek Singh and @Sachin Mittal, I waited a few weeks and wondered if I'd ever hear back.  I feel like the poster child for imposter syndrome in the web3 world and I was more than surprised when I got the email inviting me to join the Kernel Genesis Block.  The rest, as they say, is history.  I'm thankful for having been included in this community of builders and thinkers and also for the whole Gitcoin community of growing open source .  I'm definitely not the deepest thinker here or the best coder (not by a country mile), but it was this community that really helped me find my footing to go from where I was (someone who felt purposeless and unfruitful in my then vocation) to where I am now (an active, engaged dev working on Ethereum infrastructure who wakes up every day excited to do what I've been called to do and to see the world get turned upside down by what we're building).  So thank you @Kevin Owocki for building Gitcoin, @Vivek Singh, @Sachin Mittal,  and@cryptowanderer for Kernel, and to others along the way who have given me opportunities to build cool stuff and to be a part of web3 like @Rob Secord and @Ben Lakoff from Charged Particles, @Mike Elias from Idea Market, various folks from the Status/Nimbus team, @Shresth Agrawal, @Jose Aguinaga...etc.","by":"acolytec3"},{"message":"I am literally reading a CIA paper because of the man.

Thanks for letting me cry in Twitter Spaces today @Vivek Singh @alisha @Angela Gilhotra @cryptowanderer @Sachin Mittal. In KB4, I've bonded, spent time with or been in the presence with these amazingly inspirational womxn of color @Vienna Looi @Songyi Lee @Holly Grimm @Jasmine Wang @Michelle Ma @Denise Schaefer @Rebecca Mqamelo @Juanna Zhai. I've been so moved by the work of @Richard Blythman @Matthew Scott Jones that I hope for the future of the “metaverse” and AI, places where I have felt trapped in centralized recreating inequalities for so long, that it's such a fresh breathe of air to see these amazing founders for their work and I can't wait to see more from them and work with them somehow in some fashion at the intersection as its relevant with my work in the future. I have an extremely long list of all the folks who demo’ed today at Showcase and Expo that I either plan on somehow integrating into in my future work (be a user, beta tester, adviser on their platform). Thank you (Salamat) again to @Alex Yao Lisa Lee Lucas (co-founder of NOVA with @Nicolas Nicolas Ponette) and Michelle Tsing (laptopradio and blockchain adviser to some companies out of Kernel and Blockchain at Berkeley accelerator) for pushing me to apply. I almost didn't and I am so glad I did. It is really encouraging me to do all the things I want to with DAOs, to not compromise my values, and stay true to myself, in a world obsessed with performative isms that is the Hollywood/Silicon Valley/DC/NY power and wealth hungry addicted and controlling egos that I try so hard to resist. Today I quit 3 social media networks, dropped 3 projects that no longer made sense, and am deciding to double down on what I believe is authentic to my nature and being, that will continue to serve me well personally and professionally in my work. Thank you so much for helping me verbally process, grow, raise hard and contentious questions and receive so many more resources and feedback I am still processing I feel like I did 5 MOOCs and a degrrr in Kernel it was far more than I expected than a YC, graduate degree, or self-help coaching session. This has been powerful for me as a community organizer, entrepreneur, software engineer, computational designer, as a woman of color, colonized person, and avid reader. I so appreciate all the hard work it takes to create content, organize logistics, moderate, facilitate, and maintain as a steward and also much love to every single person in the Kernel community who has been responsive with every chat, every request, and every ask I have made whether verbal, written or otherwise. I am constantly amazed by this community and am so privileged to be a part of it. It's been an honor to be selected as a fellow and I can only hope I live up to what I set out to do next now with a framework that helps heal me and keep me grounded away from a hamster wheel that is life. I am taking a major cooling period after December and hope to share more work come 2022 with Kernel (maybe a future showcase), of all that's been incubating and cooking up in my head, behind Code editors and things I haven't pushed to GitHub, announced or made live yet. Lastly, thank you @Kevin Owocki for founding GitCoin, seeing you speak at Dystopia Labs and other conferences over the years always impressed me and I'm floored to have participated somehow in some small way related remotely to the work that you do, it is so important for the liberation of all people in the world and I hope that it continues to evolve with each Kernel block in the future.","by":"Erin Pangilinan"},{"message":"Thanks to @Alex Yao who’s got something special going on ","by":"Zorie Barber"},{"message":"Also, had a great first junto on decentralized media hosted by @Alex Yao with @Diana Chen, @Sarah Hamburg and more!","by":"Ali Jaffar"}],"count":3},"attributes":[{"trait_type":"award","value":"Renaissance Man"},{"trait_type":"testimonial","value":"Alex - we wish you the deepest joy on your journey ahead - the chance to share your truth while exploring what it means with other truly is a Renaissance.

For that reason I am grateful to my friend, peer, co-founder and comrade in Web 3 @Tagan Horton.

Thanks for letting me cry in Twitter Spaces today @Vivek Singh @alisha @Angela Gilhotra @cryptowanderer @Sachin Mittal. In KB4, I've bonded, spent time with or been in the presence with these amazingly inspirational womxn of color @Vienna Looi @Songyi Lee @Holly Grimm @Jasmine Wang @Michelle Ma @Denise Schaefer @Rebecca Mqamelo @Juanna Zhai. I've been so moved by the work of @Richard Blythman @Matthew Scott Jones that I hope for the future of the “metaverse” and AI, places where I have felt trapped in centralized recreating inequalities for so long, that it's such a fresh breathe of air to see these amazing founders for their work and I can't wait to see more from them and work with them somehow in some fashion at the intersection as its relevant with my work in the future. I have an extremely long list of all the folks who demo’ed today at Showcase and Expo that I either plan on somehow integrating into in my future work (be a user, beta tester, adviser on their platform). Thank you (Salamat) again to @Alex Yao Lisa Lee Lucas (co-founder of NOVA with @Nicolas Nicolas Ponette) and Michelle Tsing (laptopradio and blockchain adviser to some companies out of Kernel and Blockchain at Berkeley accelerator) for pushing me to apply. I almost didn't and I am so glad I did. It is really encouraging me to do all the things I want to with DAOs, to not compromise my values, and stay true to myself, in a world obsessed with performative isms that is the Hollywood/Silicon Valley/DC/NY power and wealth hungry addicted and controlling egos that I try so hard to resist. Today I quit 3 social media networks, dropped 3 projects that no longer made sense, and am deciding to double down on what I believe is authentic to my nature and being, that will continue to serve me well personally and professionally in my work. Thank you so much for helping me verbally process, grow, raise hard and contentious questions and receive so many more resources and feedback I am still processing I feel like I did 5 MOOCs and a degrrr in Kernel it was far more than I expected than a YC, graduate degree, or self-help coaching session. This has been powerful for me as a community organizer, entrepreneur, software engineer, computational designer, as a woman of color, colonized person, and avid reader. I so appreciate all the hard work it takes to create content, organize logistics, moderate, facilitate, and maintain as a steward and also much love to every single person in the Kernel community who has been responsive with every chat, every request, and every ask I have made whether verbal, written or otherwise. I am constantly amazed by this community and am so privileged to be a part of it. It's been an honor to be selected as a fellow and I can only hope I live up to what I set out to do next now with a framework that helps heal me and keep me grounded away from a hamster wheel that is life. I am taking a major cooling period after December and hope to share more work come 2022 with Kernel (maybe a future showcase), of all that's been incubating and cooking up in my head, behind Code editors and things I haven't pushed to GitHub, announced or made live yet. Lastly, thank you @Kevin Owocki for founding GitCoin, seeing you speak at Dystopia Labs and other conferences over the years always impressed me and I'm floored to have participated somehow in some small way related remotely to the work that you do, it is so important for the liberation of all people in the world and I hope that it continues to evolve with each Kernel block in the future.","by":"Erin Pangilinan"},{"message":"Wow, is all I can say.

Ultimately Kernel overall has challenged me a lot to think highly about quality, to be a better more soulful version of myself. I also appreciate the fact that there is so much attention paid to with artists, poetry, and things that make me feel human again, many things that I have felt are never shared in other spaces I traversed from the get-go the last 7 years (AR VR AI in particular), and being human-centric in mind in that regard. I feel very nourished and rejuvenated.

I would be asking myself \"WTF are they talking about?\" during fireside chats or random juntos; I'd get frustrated with how (maybe intentionally) unclear KERNEL is (you have to create your own adventure, of which KERNEL is a tool... I guess); I'd get a little jealous seeing all the people saying thank you on this channel, feeling \"should I be doing more to get as enthusiastic and happy as them?\"; and just generally anxious for not having enough time to be with my family, do my full-time job (not for long), work on the next adventure, and also read and watch all the curated material.\n\nI'm not gonna lie, I still have those negative (complementary opposing) feelings... at least sometimes :slightly_smiling_face:.\n\n:mostly_sunny:But then I realized people and groups don't (necessarily) care about my expectations. I really understood and appreciated the \"group with loosely shared interests\" description of the fellows. I started to find new language to express my ideas, to communicate better, and to just appreciate those conflicting feelings, because they moved me to action. I found myself having more conversations and asking better questions (initially just to myself). And finally, thanks to a conversation with @Sarah Hamburg, who wisely said \"KERNEL is a marathon, not a sprint\" (Thanks for that, Sarah!), I started to think more long-term.\n\n:kernel-love: Thank you for igniting this in me. From this inner turmoil, love-hate relationship, that KERNEL has been, a new (hopefully better) Guillermo emerges.\nI look forward to more adventures together and continue to obsessively check this slack in the future (I struggle to control my FOMO). Thanks @Sarah Hamburg @Holly Grimm @Saskia Westhof @Aimara Garcia Cabezas @Greg Becker @Ray Di Felice @snax y-not @Tim Courtney for amazing conversations.\n\nFinally, the whole theme of KERNEL reminded me of <https://sites.evergreen.edu/politicalshakespeares/wp-content/uploads/sites/226/2015/12/Borges-Tl%C3%B6n-Uqbar-Orbius-Tertius.pdf|\"Tlon, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius\">, by my favorite author Jorge Luis Borges.

I would be asking myself \"WTF are they talking about?\" during fireside chats or random juntos; I'd get frustrated with how (maybe intentionally) unclear KERNEL is (you have to create your own adventure, of which KERNEL is a tool... I guess); I'd get a little jealous seeing all the people saying thank you on this channel, feeling \"should I be doing more to get as enthusiastic and happy as them?\"; and just generally anxious for not having enough time to be with my family, do my full-time job (not for long), work on the next adventure, and also read and watch all the curated material.\n\nI'm not gonna lie, I still have those negative (complementary opposing) feelings... at least sometimes :slightly_smiling_face:.\n\n:mostly_sunny:But then I realized people and groups don't (necessarily) care about my expectations. I really understood and appreciated the \"group with loosely shared interests\" description of the fellows.

Thanks for letting me cry in Twitter Spaces today @Vivek Singh @alisha @Angela Gilhotra @cryptowanderer @Sachin Mittal. In KB4, I've bonded, spent time with or been in the presence with these amazingly inspirational womxn of color @Vienna Looi @Songyi Lee @Holly Grimm @Jasmine Wang @Michelle Ma @Denise Schaefer @Rebecca Mqamelo @Juanna Zhai. I've been so moved by the work of @Richard Blythman @Matthew Scott Jones that I hope for the future of the “metaverse” and AI, places where I have felt trapped in centralized recreating inequalities for so long, that it's such a fresh breathe of air to see these amazing founders for their work and I can't wait to see more from them and work with them somehow in some fashion at the intersection as its relevant with my work in the future. I have an extremely long list of all the folks who demo’ed today at Showcase and Expo that I either plan on somehow integrating into in my future work (be a user, beta tester, adviser on their platform). Thank you (Salamat) again to @Alex Yao Lisa Lee Lucas (co-founder of NOVA with @Nicolas Nicolas Ponette) and Michelle Tsing (laptopradio and blockchain adviser to some companies out of Kernel and Blockchain at Berkeley accelerator) for pushing me to apply. I almost didn't and I am so glad I did. It is really encouraging me to do all the things I want to with DAOs, to not compromise my values, and stay true to myself, in a world obsessed with performative isms that is the Hollywood/Silicon Valley/DC/NY power and wealth hungry addicted and controlling egos that I try so hard to resist. Today I quit 3 social media networks, dropped 3 projects that no longer made sense, and am deciding to double down on what I believe is authentic to my nature and being, that will continue to serve me well personally and professionally in my work. Thank you so much for helping me verbally process, grow, raise hard and contentious questions and receive so many more resources and feedback I am still processing I feel like I did 5 MOOCs and a degrrr in Kernel it was far more than I expected than a YC, graduate degree, or self-help coaching session. This has been powerful for me as a community organizer, entrepreneur, software engineer, computational designer, as a woman of color, colonized person, and avid reader. I so appreciate all the hard work it takes to create content, organize logistics, moderate, facilitate, and maintain as a steward and also much love to every single person in the Kernel community who has been responsive with every chat, every request, and every ask I have made whether verbal, written or otherwise. I am constantly amazed by this community and am so privileged to be a part of it. It's been an honor to be selected as a fellow and I can only hope I live up to what I set out to do next now with a framework that helps heal me and keep me grounded away from a hamster wheel that is life. I am taking a major cooling period after December and hope to share more work come 2022 with Kernel (maybe a future showcase), of all that's been incubating and cooking up in my head, behind Code editors and things I haven't pushed to GitHub, announced or made live yet. Lastly, thank you @Kevin Owocki for founding GitCoin, seeing you speak at Dystopia Labs and other conferences over the years always impressed me and I'm floored to have participated somehow in some small way related remotely to the work that you do, it is so important for the liberation of all people in the world and I hope that it continues to evolve with each Kernel block in the future.","by":"Erin Pangilinan"},{"message":"A huge thank you to @Richard Blythman for the work he is doing on Algovera, which has been running as a recurring Kernel junto and is now its own guild (much like @Michael Keating's wonderful work with the tokenaughts): <https://kernel.community/en/build/decentralized-ai/>\n\nIf you're into either decentralizing AI, or tokenomics, or both - make sure to check out all the new resources on our build pages thanks to these wonderful people :kernel-love:","by":"cryptowanderer"},{"message":"I thoroughly enjoyed the decentralized AI Zoom you held yesterday @Richard Blythman.

Thanks for letting me cry in Twitter Spaces today @Vivek Singh @alisha @Angela Gilhotra @cryptowanderer @Sachin Mittal. In KB4, I've bonded, spent time with or been in the presence with these amazingly inspirational womxn of color @Vienna Looi @Songyi Lee @Holly Grimm @Jasmine Wang @Michelle Ma @Denise Schaefer @Rebecca Mqamelo @Juanna Zhai. I've been so moved by the work of @Richard Blythman @Matthew Scott Jones that I hope for the future of the “metaverse” and AI, places where I have felt trapped in centralized recreating inequalities for so long, that it's such a fresh breathe of air to see these amazing founders for their work and I can't wait to see more from them and work with them somehow in some fashion at the intersection as its relevant with my work in the future. I have an extremely long list of all the folks who demo’ed today at Showcase and Expo that I either plan on somehow integrating into in my future work (be a user, beta tester, adviser on their platform). Thank you (Salamat) again to @Alex Yao Lisa Lee Lucas (co-founder of NOVA with @Nicolas Nicolas Ponette) and Michelle Tsing (laptopradio and blockchain adviser to some companies out of Kernel and Blockchain at Berkeley accelerator) for pushing me to apply. I almost didn't and I am so glad I did. It is really encouraging me to do all the things I want to with DAOs, to not compromise my values, and stay true to myself, in a world obsessed with performative isms that is the Hollywood/Silicon Valley/DC/NY power and wealth hungry addicted and controlling egos that I try so hard to resist. Today I quit 3 social media networks, dropped 3 projects that no longer made sense, and am deciding to double down on what I believe is authentic to my nature and being, that will continue to serve me well personally and professionally in my work. Thank you so much for helping me verbally process, grow, raise hard and contentious questions and receive so many more resources and feedback I am still processing I feel like I did 5 MOOCs and a degrrr in Kernel it was far more than I expected than a YC, graduate degree, or self-help coaching session. This has been powerful for me as a community organizer, entrepreneur, software engineer, computational designer, as a woman of color, colonized person, and avid reader. I so appreciate all the hard work it takes to create content, organize logistics, moderate, facilitate, and maintain as a steward and also much love to every single person in the Kernel community who has been responsive with every chat, every request, and every ask I have made whether verbal, written or otherwise. I am constantly amazed by this community and am so privileged to be a part of it. It's been an honor to be selected as a fellow and I can only hope I live up to what I set out to do next now with a framework that helps heal me and keep me grounded away from a hamster wheel that is life. I am taking a major cooling period after December and hope to share more work come 2022 with Kernel (maybe a future showcase), of all that's been incubating and cooking up in my head, behind Code editors and things I haven't pushed to GitHub, announced or made live yet. Lastly, thank you @Kevin Owocki for founding GitCoin, seeing you speak at Dystopia Labs and other conferences over the years always impressed me and I'm floored to have participated somehow in some small way related remotely to the work that you do, it is so important for the liberation of all people in the world and I hope that it continues to evolve with each Kernel block in the future.","by":"Erin Pangilinan"},{"message":":heart: Very thankful to @Juanna Zhai @Mitzy C @Chase Chapman for bringing up Kernel and encouraging joining Kernel :smiling_face_with_3_hearts: And honestly just for this whole community.

Thanks for letting me cry in Twitter Spaces today @Vivek Singh @alisha @Angela Gilhotra @cryptowanderer @Sachin Mittal. In KB4, I've bonded, spent time with or been in the presence with these amazingly inspirational womxn of color @Vienna Looi @Songyi Lee @Holly Grimm @Jasmine Wang @Michelle Ma @Denise Schaefer @Rebecca Mqamelo @Juanna Zhai. I've been so moved by the work of @Richard Blythman @Matthew Scott Jones that I hope for the future of the “metaverse” and AI, places where I have felt trapped in centralized recreating inequalities for so long, that it's such a fresh breathe of air to see these amazing founders for their work and I can't wait to see more from them and work with them somehow in some fashion at the intersection as its relevant with my work in the future. I have an extremely long list of all the folks who demo’ed today at Showcase and Expo that I either plan on somehow integrating into in my future work (be a user, beta tester, adviser on their platform). Thank you (Salamat) again to @Alex Yao Lisa Lee Lucas (co-founder of NOVA with @Nicolas Nicolas Ponette) and Michelle Tsing (laptopradio and blockchain adviser to some companies out of Kernel and Blockchain at Berkeley accelerator) for pushing me to apply. I almost didn't and I am so glad I did. It is really encouraging me to do all the things I want to with DAOs, to not compromise my values, and stay true to myself, in a world obsessed with performative isms that is the Hollywood/Silicon Valley/DC/NY power and wealth hungry addicted and controlling egos that I try so hard to resist. Today I quit 3 social media networks, dropped 3 projects that no longer made sense, and am deciding to double down on what I believe is authentic to my nature and being, that will continue to serve me well personally and professionally in my work. Thank you so much for helping me verbally process, grow, raise hard and contentious questions and receive so many more resources and feedback I am still processing I feel like I did 5 MOOCs and a degrrr in Kernel it was far more than I expected than a YC, graduate degree, or self-help coaching session. This has been powerful for me as a community organizer, entrepreneur, software engineer, computational designer, as a woman of color, colonized person, and avid reader. I so appreciate all the hard work it takes to create content, organize logistics, moderate, facilitate, and maintain as a steward and also much love to every single person in the Kernel community who has been responsive with every chat, every request, and every ask I have made whether verbal, written or otherwise. I am constantly amazed by this community and am so privileged to be a part of it. It's been an honor to be selected as a fellow and I can only hope I live up to what I set out to do next now with a framework that helps heal me and keep me grounded away from a hamster wheel that is life. I am taking a major cooling period after December and hope to share more work come 2022 with Kernel (maybe a future showcase), of all that's been incubating and cooking up in my head, behind Code editors and things I haven't pushed to GitHub, announced or made live yet. Lastly, thank you @Kevin Owocki for founding GitCoin, seeing you speak at Dystopia Labs and other conferences over the years always impressed me and I'm floored to have participated somehow in some small way related remotely to the work that you do, it is so important for the liberation of all people in the world and I hope that it continues to evolve with each Kernel block in the future.","by":"Erin Pangilinan"},{"message":"Wow, is all I can say.

I almost didn't and I am so glad I did.

This has been powerful for me as a community organizer, entrepreneur, software engineer, computational designer, as a woman of color, colonized person, and avid reader. I so appreciate all the hard work it takes to create content, organize logistics, moderate, facilitate, and maintain as a steward and also much love to every single person in the Kernel community who has been responsive with every chat, every request, and every ask I have made whether verbal, written or otherwise. I am constantly amazed by this community and am so privileged to be a part of it. It's been an honor to be selected as a fellow and I can only hope I live up to what I set out to do next now with a framework that helps heal me and keep me grounded away from a hamster wheel that is life. I am taking a major cooling period after December and hope to share more work come 2022 with Kernel (maybe a future showcase), of all that's been incubating and cooking up in my head, behind Code editors and things I haven't pushed to GitHub, announced or made live yet. Lastly, thank you @Kevin Owocki for founding GitCoin, seeing you speak at Dystopia Labs and other conferences over the years always impressed me and I'm floored to have participated somehow in some small way related remotely to the work that you do, it is so important for the liberation of all people in the world and I hope that it continues to evolve with each Kernel block in the future.","by":"Erin Pangilinan"},{"message":"Thank you to @alisha @Michael Keating @Artem B. and @Michelle Ma for a great discussion on tokens in our junto breakout room yesterday!","by":"Sylvia R"}],"count":3},"attributes":[{"trait_type":"award","value":"Protector of Dual Power"},{"trait_type":"testimonial","value":"Michelle - thank you for simply being you.

It's been an honor to be selected as a fellow and I can only hope I live up to what I set out to do next now with a framework that helps heal me and keep me grounded away from a hamster wheel that is life. I am taking a major cooling period after December and hope to share more work come 2022 with Kernel (maybe a future showcase), of all that's been incubating and cooking up in my head, behind Code editors and things I haven't pushed to GitHub, announced or made live yet. Lastly, thank you @Kevin Owocki for founding GitCoin, seeing you speak at Dystopia Labs and other conferences over the years always impressed me and I'm floored to have participated somehow in some small way related remotely to the work that you do, it is so important for the liberation of all people in the world and I hope that it continues to evolve with each Kernel block in the future.","by":"Erin Pangilinan"},{"message":"@Andros Wong &amp; @Songyi Lee thank you both for your time and patience, as is the nature of reciprocity I feel indebted to you both if ever there's anything I can do, well lets keep in touch :rainbowheart:","by":"Renee Maria Lee"},{"message":"@Songyi Lee @Tim Courtney @snax y-not all for points on curation vs. volume discussion and thoughts on DAOs modeled as libraries / supportive of different personal hobbies.

Thanks for letting me cry in Twitter Spaces today @Vivek Singh @alisha @Angela Gilhotra @cryptowanderer @Sachin Mittal. In KB4, I've bonded, spent time with or been in the presence with these amazingly inspirational womxn of color @Vienna Looi @Songyi Lee @Holly Grimm @Jasmine Wang @Michelle Ma @Denise Schaefer @Rebecca Mqamelo @Juanna Zhai. I've been so moved by the work of @Richard Blythman @Matthew Scott Jones that I hope for the future of the “metaverse” and AI, places where I have felt trapped in centralized recreating inequalities for so long, that it's such a fresh breathe of air to see these amazing founders for their work and I can't wait to see more from them and work with them somehow in some fashion at the intersection as its relevant with my work in the future. I have an extremely long list of all the folks who demo’ed today at Showcase and Expo that I either plan on somehow integrating into in my future work (be a user, beta tester, adviser on their platform). Thank you (Salamat) again to @Alex Yao Lisa Lee Lucas (co-founder of NOVA with @Nicolas Nicolas Ponette) and Michelle Tsing (laptopradio and blockchain adviser to some companies out of Kernel and Blockchain at Berkeley accelerator) for pushing me to apply. I almost didn't and I am so glad I did. It is really encouraging me to do all the things I want to with DAOs, to not compromise my values, and stay true to myself, in a world obsessed with performative isms that is the Hollywood/Silicon Valley/DC/NY power and wealth hungry addicted and controlling egos that I try so hard to resist. Today I quit 3 social media networks, dropped 3 projects that no longer made sense, and am deciding to double down on what I believe is authentic to my nature and being, that will continue to serve me well personally and professionally in my work. Thank you so much for helping me verbally process, grow, raise hard and contentious questions and receive so many more resources and feedback I am still processing I feel like I did 5 MOOCs and a degrrr in Kernel it was far more than I expected than a YC, graduate degree, or self-help coaching session. This has been powerful for me as a community organizer, entrepreneur, software engineer, computational designer, as a woman of color, colonized person, and avid reader. I so appreciate all the hard work it takes to create content, organize logistics, moderate, facilitate, and maintain as a steward and also much love to every single person in the Kernel community who has been responsive with every chat, every request, and every ask I have made whether verbal, written or otherwise. I am constantly amazed by this community and am so privileged to be a part of it. It's been an honor to be selected as a fellow and I can only hope I live up to what I set out to do next now with a framework that helps heal me and keep me grounded away from a hamster wheel that is life. I am taking a major cooling period after December and hope to share more work come 2022 with Kernel (maybe a future showcase), of all that's been incubating and cooking up in my head, behind Code editors and things I haven't pushed to GitHub, announced or made live yet. Lastly, thank you @Kevin Owocki for founding GitCoin, seeing you speak at Dystopia Labs and other conferences over the years always impressed me and I'm floored to have participated somehow in some small way related remotely to the work that you do, it is so important for the liberation of all people in the world and I hope that it continues to evolve with each Kernel block in the future.","by":"Erin Pangilinan"},{"message":"Wow, is all I can say.

Ultimately Kernel overall has challenged me a lot to think highly about quality, to be a better more soulful version of myself. I also appreciate the fact that there is so much attention paid to with artists, poetry, and things that make me feel human again, many things that I have felt are never shared in other spaces I traversed from the get-go the last 7 years (AR VR AI in particular), and being human-centric in mind in that regard. I feel very nourished and rejuvenated. While I have a lot on my plate, I also want to +1 what Vivek said about ‘double majoring and minoring’ while I try to get a way with showcasing I wish 3 ventures next week at Expo, I’ll really limit it to 1-2 so I can showcase quality to the rest of the Kernel community.

I would be asking myself \"WTF are they talking about?\" during fireside chats or random juntos; I'd get frustrated with how (maybe intentionally) unclear KERNEL is (you have to create your own adventure, of which KERNEL is a tool... I guess); I'd get a little jealous seeing all the people saying thank you on this channel, feeling \"should I be doing more to get as enthusiastic and happy as them?\"; and just generally anxious for not having enough time to be with my family, do my full-time job (not for long), work on the next adventure, and also read and watch all the curated material.\n\nI'm not gonna lie, I still have those negative (complementary opposing) feelings... at least sometimes :slightly_smiling_face:.\n\n:mostly_sunny:But then I realized people and groups don't (necessarily) care about my expectations. I really understood and appreciated the \"group with loosely shared interests\" description of the fellows. I started to find new language to express my ideas, to communicate better, and to just appreciate those conflicting feelings, because they moved me to action. I found myself having more conversations and asking better questions (initially just to myself). And finally, thanks to a conversation with @Sarah Hamburg, who wisely said \"KERNEL is a marathon, not a sprint\" (Thanks for that, Sarah!), I started to think more long-term.\n\n:kernel-love: Thank you for igniting this in me. From this inner turmoil, love-hate relationship, that KERNEL has been, a new (hopefully better) Guillermo emerges.\nI look forward to more adventures together and continue to obsessively check this slack in the future (I struggle to control my FOMO).

Thanks for letting me cry in Twitter Spaces today @Vivek Singh @alisha @Angela Gilhotra @cryptowanderer @Sachin Mittal. In KB4, I've bonded, spent time with or been in the presence with these amazingly inspirational womxn of color @Vienna Looi @Songyi Lee @Holly Grimm @Jasmine Wang @Michelle Ma @Denise Schaefer @Rebecca Mqamelo @Juanna Zhai. I've been so moved by the work of @Richard Blythman @Matthew Scott Jones that I hope for the future of the “metaverse” and AI, places where I have felt trapped in centralized recreating inequalities for so long, that it's such a fresh breathe of air to see these amazing founders for their work and I can't wait to see more from them and work with them somehow in some fashion at the intersection as its relevant with my work in the future. I have an extremely long list of all the folks who demo’ed today at Showcase and Expo that I either plan on somehow integrating into in my future work (be a user, beta tester, adviser on their platform). Thank you (Salamat) again to @Alex Yao Lisa Lee Lucas (co-founder of NOVA with @Nicolas Nicolas Ponette) and Michelle Tsing (laptopradio and blockchain adviser to some companies out of Kernel and Blockchain at Berkeley accelerator) for pushing me to apply. I almost didn't and I am so glad I did. It is really encouraging me to do all the things I want to with DAOs, to not compromise my values, and stay true to myself, in a world obsessed with performative isms that is the Hollywood/Silicon Valley/DC/NY power and wealth hungry addicted and controlling egos that I try so hard to resist. Today I quit 3 social media networks, dropped 3 projects that no longer made sense, and am deciding to double down on what I believe is authentic to my nature and being, that will continue to serve me well personally and professionally in my work. Thank you so much for helping me verbally process, grow, raise hard and contentious questions and receive so many more resources and feedback I am still processing I feel like I did 5 MOOCs and a degrrr in Kernel it was far more than I expected than a YC, graduate degree, or self-help coaching session. This has been powerful for me as a community organizer, entrepreneur, software engineer, computational designer, as a woman of color, colonized person, and avid reader. I so appreciate all the hard work it takes to create content, organize logistics, moderate, facilitate, and maintain as a steward and also much love to every single person in the Kernel community who has been responsive with every chat, every request, and every ask I have made whether verbal, written or otherwise. I am constantly amazed by this community and am so privileged to be a part of it. It's been an honor to be selected as a fellow and I can only hope I live up to what I set out to do next now with a framework that helps heal me and keep me grounded away from a hamster wheel that is life. I am taking a major cooling period after December and hope to share more work come 2022 with Kernel (maybe a future showcase), of all that's been incubating and cooking up in my head, behind Code editors and things I haven't pushed to GitHub, announced or made live yet. Lastly, thank you @Kevin Owocki for founding GitCoin, seeing you speak at Dystopia Labs and other conferences over the years always impressed me and I'm floored to have participated somehow in some small way related remotely to the work that you do, it is so important for the liberation of all people in the world and I hope that it continues to evolve with each Kernel block in the future.","by":"Erin Pangilinan"},{"message":"Wow, is all I can say.

I would be asking myself \"WTF are they talking about?\" during fireside chats or random juntos; I'd get frustrated with how (maybe intentionally) unclear KERNEL is (you have to create your own adventure, of which KERNEL is a tool... I guess); I'd get a little jealous seeing all the people saying thank you on this channel, feeling \"should I be doing more to get as enthusiastic and happy as them?\"; and just generally anxious for not having enough time to be with my family, do my full-time job (not for long), work on the next adventure, and also read and watch all the curated material.\n\nI'm not gonna lie, I still have those negative (complementary opposing) feelings... at least sometimes :slightly_smiling_face:.\n\n:mostly_sunny:But then I realized people and groups don't (necessarily) care about my expectations. I really understood and appreciated the \"group with loosely shared interests\" description of the fellows. I started to find new language to express my ideas, to communicate better, and to just appreciate those conflicting feelings, because they moved me to action. I found myself having more conversations and asking better questions (initially just to myself). And finally, thanks to a conversation with @Sarah Hamburg, who wisely said \"KERNEL is a marathon, not a sprint\" (Thanks for that, Sarah!), I started to think more long-term.\n\n:kernel-love: Thank you for igniting this in me.

In KB4, I've bonded, spent time with or been in the presence with these amazingly inspirational womxn of color @Vienna Looi @Songyi Lee @Holly Grimm @Jasmine Wang @Michelle Ma @Denise Schaefer @Rebecca Mqamelo @Juanna Zhai. I've been so moved by the work of @Richard Blythman @Matthew Scott Jones that I hope for the future of the “metaverse” and AI, places where I have felt trapped in centralized recreating inequalities for so long, that it's such a fresh breathe of air to see these amazing founders for their work and I can't wait to see more from them and work with them somehow in some fashion at the intersection as its relevant with my work in the future. I have an extremely long list of all the folks who demo’ed today at Showcase and Expo that I either plan on somehow integrating into in my future work (be a user, beta tester, adviser on their platform). Thank you (Salamat) again to @Alex Yao Lisa Lee Lucas (co-founder of NOVA with @Nicolas Nicolas Ponette) and Michelle Tsing (laptopradio and blockchain adviser to some companies out of Kernel and Blockchain at Berkeley accelerator) for pushing me to apply. I almost didn't and I am so glad I did. It is really encouraging me to do all the things I want to with DAOs, to not compromise my values, and stay true to myself, in a world obsessed with performative isms that is the Hollywood/Silicon Valley/DC/NY power and wealth hungry addicted and controlling egos that I try so hard to resist. Today I quit 3 social media networks, dropped 3 projects that no longer made sense, and am deciding to double down on what I believe is authentic to my nature and being, that will continue to serve me well personally and professionally in my work. Thank you so much for helping me verbally process, grow, raise hard and contentious questions and receive so many more resources and feedback I am still processing I feel like I did 5 MOOCs and a degrrr in Kernel it was far more than I expected than a YC, graduate degree, or self-help coaching session. This has been powerful for me as a community organizer, entrepreneur, software engineer, computational designer, as a woman of color, colonized person, and avid reader. I so appreciate all the hard work it takes to create content, organize logistics, moderate, facilitate, and maintain as a steward and also much love to every single person in the Kernel community who has been responsive with every chat, every request, and every ask I have made whether verbal, written or otherwise. I am constantly amazed by this community and am so privileged to be a part of it. It's been an honor to be selected as a fellow and I can only hope I live up to what I set out to do next now with a framework that helps heal me and keep me grounded away from a hamster wheel that is life. I am taking a major cooling period after December and hope to share more work come 2022 with Kernel (maybe a future showcase), of all that's been incubating and cooking up in my head, behind Code editors and things I haven't pushed to GitHub, announced or made live yet. Lastly, thank you @Kevin Owocki for founding GitCoin, seeing you speak at Dystopia Labs and other conferences over the years always impressed me and I'm floored to have participated somehow in some small way related remotely to the work that you do, it is so important for the liberation of all people in the world and I hope that it continues to evolve with each Kernel block in the future.","by":"Erin Pangilinan"},{"message":"Wow, is all I can say.
